Students can check the Student Service Centre to see if they are eligible to register as a second-year BSc student (and thus able to use the online coordinated admissions process) in June.

Students who are entering third year and wish to pursue a Behavioural Neuroscience specialization must apply online through the Department of Psychology’s website for admission in June.

Students registered in Behavioural Neuroscience specializations must take 6 credits of Faculty of Arts courses other than psychology. Science electives may not be psychology courses. All psychology courses numbered 60 to 89 in the last two digits have science credit. Students may not earn more than a combined 12 credits of Directed Studies in Psychology or Behavioural Neuroscience (PSYC 340, 348, 388, 440, 448, and 488).

### Co-operative Education Program in Behavioural Neuroscience

Co-operative Education is a process of education which integrates academic study with related and supervised work experience in co-operating employer organizations.

An optional Co-operative Education Program is available for students in the Behavioural Neuroscience specializations. The Program, which is intended to help prepare interested and qualified students for research careers in industry, university, or government settings, includes at least 16 months of work placement (i.e., at least four work terms) supervised by scientists in industrial, academic or governmental positions. Co-op advisors visit students at their place of work and provide advice on work term reports required of all students in the program. The four work terms are normally taken consecutively beginning in Summer Session after third year and ending in Summer Session after fourth year.

To be eligible, students must be in a Behavioural Neuroscience specialization, and they must have completed at least one academic term in this program. Admission is by application to the Science Co-op Office. Selection of students is based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment, as determined by resumé and interview. The total enrolment is subject to the availability of appropriate work placements. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between students and employing organizations. Participating students register for PSYC 398, 399, 498, or 499, as appropriate, and pay the Cooperative Education program fee per course as well as [Co-operative Education Program Fees](/node/15554).

Graduation in the Co-operative Education Program for Behavioural Neuroscience requires a student to complete PSYC 398, 399, 498, and 499, in addition to the normal academic requirements. Students may choose appropriate timing of their work terms, but some of the four work placements required should not be in the summer.

Detailed information on the program can be obtained from the [Behavioural Neuroscience specialization advisors](http://psych.ubc.ca/undergraduate/behavioural-neuroscience-programs) or from the Co-operative Education Program.

**Students interested in neuroscience should consider applying to the new [Neuroscience specialization](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/neuroscience).**

For a Behavioural Neuroscience minor, students are required to take PSYC 100 or both of PSYC 101 and 102, and at least 18 credits of 300- or 400-level psychology courses numbered 60 to 87 in the last two digits.

**B.Sc., Arts Minor in Psychology**

For a PSYC Arts minor, students are required to take PSYC 100 or both of PSYC 101 and PSYC 102; 6 credits of 200-level psychology, preferably PSYC 207 and 208 in second year; and at least 18 credits of 300-/400-level psychology courses, excluding PSYC 340, 348, 388, 440, 448, or 488.
The [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://www.biochem.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](/node/15013).

Students wishing to enter second-year Biochemistry Major, Honours, or Combined Honours specializations must apply using the online process administered by the [Faculty of Science](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply). Students will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Due to the similarity between the major and honours biochemistry specializations in second year, the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to either the Major or Combined Honours. Qualified students wishing to transfer to Honours Biochemistry should contact the Undergraduate Advisor for advice. Only students in the second year Combined Majors or Combined Honours in Biochemistry and Chemistry specializations will be required to register using a Standard Timetable (STT) available on the registration system. The progress of continuing biochemistry students will be reviewed at the end of each academic year. Students making satisfactory progress do not require annual specialization approval. The Department will contact students with unsatisfactory standing in honours or combined honours.

The major specialization provides a strong background in biochemistry and is sufficiently flexible for students to develop their interests in allied fields (e.g., microbiology, food science, and chemistry). It is also appropriate for students who anticipate a professional career in the health sciences. The honours specialization is the recommended route for students interested in graduate studies in biochemistry or related disciplines. However, students enrolled in a major specialization with a strong academic record may also apply for graduate studies. For more information, see [Biochemistry](http://www.biochem.ubc.ca).

### Co-operative (Co-op) Education Option

The department offers an optional Co-op Education Option (honours and majors). The program is open to interested and qualified students and is intended to provide additional practical and technical biochemical and molecular biological experience in academic and industrial research laboratories. This is normally achieved through a period of 12 to 15 months of approved work placement under the supervision of practising professionals. A faculty advisor will be assigned to each internship student. Acceptance into the Co-op Option is based upon academic standing and general suitability to perform in a technical research environment. The first phase is a placement for three or four months (summer following third year) in an academic research or industrial laboratory (either at UBC or at an off-campus site). This is normally followed by placement in off-site laboratories for three consecutive, four-month terms. Placements are arranged by mutual agreement of the student, employer, and faculty advisor through the Office of Co-operative Education. Students participating in the Co-op Option must register for off-site placements by using BIOC 398, 399, 498 and, where appropriate, 499, and pay the co-op education program fee for each course. After completion of the work terms, students return to the University for completion of the normal fourth-year major or honours academic requirements. This option requires five years and is not a requirement for admission to the graduate program in biochemistry and molecular biology.

Enrolment in the Co-op Education Option is limited; continuation in the option is contingent on the availability of suitable work placements. For more information contact the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).

The departments of [Botany](http://www.botany.ubc.ca) and [Zoology](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca) jointly offer one undergraduate degree. For information on advanced programs in biology, see graduate [Botany](/node/15016) and [Zoology](/node/15110). Students wishing to undertake a graduate program in biology should contact the life science departments most appropriate to the field of specialization.

There are several undergraduate degree options leading to a major or honours in biology or a combined major or combined honours in biology and chemistry, biology and oceanography, or biology and computer science. See the [Biology Program Guide](http://www.biology.ubc.ca/biology-program/new-biology-program/) for details. It is also possible to add a [minor](/node/15407) in another subject.

Courses in marine sciences are offered at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (BMSC) on Vancouver Island operated by the Western Canadian Universities Marine Sciences Society (WCUMSS). Students who have completed second year and have suitable course prerequisites may take combinations of 3-week or 6-week courses during Summer Session to a maximum of 18 credits each summer. BMSC also offers a 4-month immersion program from September to December (15 credits). Please visit the [BMSC website](http://www.bamfieldmsc.com/) for more information or consult the Biology office.

### Biology Specialization Requirements

Students who are entering second year and wish to pursue a biology specialization must apply using the [online process](http://science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply) administered by the Faculty of Science. Students will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Due to the similarity between the major and honours biology specializations in second year, the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to the Major, Combined Major, or the Combined Honours.

Students who are not eligible for entry into a biology specialization using the second-year online process can apply for entrance into third-year biology specializations during the months of May and August. For further information on our specializations and admission process, please see the [Biology website](http://www.biology.ubc.ca). Students transferring from other institutions into third-year biology and who have completed the prerequisite courses may submit late applications as needed. Students who have already been admitted into a second-year biology specialization do not need to reapply for admission in third year unless they are applying to enter an honours specialization.

Qualified students wishing to enter a biology honours specialization should contact the [Biology Office](http://www.biology.ubc.ca). Students wishing to enter a biology honours specialization must have a 75% average in courses taken during the previous Winter Session and meet all other honours requirements. Students can apply for entrance to a biology honours specialization during the months of May and August.

Progress of continuing biology students will be [reviewed](/node/15380) and considered for [promotion](/node/15388) at the end of each academic year.

### Co-operative Education Program

This optional program integrates academic study and supervised work experience. Enrolment is limited. Admissibility to the third-year biology B.Sc. program is prerequisite for admission. Detailed information is available from the [Biology Program Office](http://www.biology.ubc.ca), or the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).

### First-Year Course Options

BIOL 112, 121 and 180 (or 140) are prerequisites to many BIOL courses. These courses are required for the major and honours specializations in biology, the combined major and the combined honours in chemical biology, the combined major and the combined honours in computer science and biology, and the combined major and combined honours in oceanography and biology. Students without one of Biology 11 or Biology 12 must take BIOL 111 before taking BIOL 112, 121 or 180. Students without Chemistry 12 must take CHEM 100 or CHEM 111 before taking BIOL 112. BIOL 180 is not required for students who have taken SCIE 001.

Students interested in meeting the entrance requirements of the Faculties or Schools of Land and Food Systems, Dentistry, Forestry, Medicine, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kinesiology, and Rehabilitation Sciences should consult the appropriate office to determine the first-year biology requirement.

The [Department of Microbiology and Immunology](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca) at UBC and the Biotechnology Program at the BC Institute of Technology (BCIT) offer a five-year joint degree Co-operative Education Program that integrates academic study at both institutions with related and supervised work experience. Enrolment is limited. Entry into the specialization is at the second-year level and requires completion of the first-year prerequisites listed below with at least the minimum admission average set by the UBC Faculty of Science for transfer into second year Honours specializations.

Student must apply for the specialization. See [BCIT Biotechnology](http://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/8910bsc) for details.

The first year of the specialization can be taken at UBC or another institution. The second and third years (taken at the BCIT campus) include two four-month work terms along with academic and technical studies. The fourth and fifth years (taken at the UBC campus) include two four-month work terms and advanced studies. Students must meet the Faculty of Science requirement to continue in this Honours specialization (see [Honours Specialization](/node/15401) requirements). Completion of the requirements for the first three years of the specialization earns a Diploma of Technology in Biotechnology.

Completion of the requirements for the entire five-year specialization earns an Honours Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology. The credentials are awarded jointly by UBC and BCIT. Students who fail to maintain the Faculty of Science requirements for continuing in honours specializations in their fourth or fifth year need to request transfer credit for their BCIT courses if they intend to enrol in the other specializations such as the Microbiology and Immunology Major.

2 Applicants from other universities and colleges may substitute 3 credits of introductory chemistry that includes a lab. Students who do not have BC high school Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100. CHEM 110 and CHEM 115 may substitute for CHEM 111. CHEM 120 and CHEM 115 may substitute for CHEM 121. CHEM 130 and CHEM 135 may substitute for CHEM 123.

3 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see [Communication Requirement](/node/15384)

4 Students must take one differential calculus course during first year of studies at UBC. MATH 180 or 184 or 120 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 1 credit. MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 3 credits.

5 Students require 3 credits of 100-level PHYS beyond PHYS 100. Students lacking Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 in first year. Another 3 credits of PHYS may be taken at any time during the specialization but PHYS 100 must be taken during first year.

6 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s:  
a) [Foundational Requirement](/node/15386);  
b) [Laboratory Science Requirement](/node/15386#18467);

f) [General Degree Requirements](/node/15405).  
Note that BCIT credits include 9 UBC Arts credits and 3 credits equivalent to UBC STAT 200.

7 Students should be aware that BIOL 140 is a prerequisite for many upper-level BIOL courses at UBC. To maintain flexibility in their ability to study at UBC, students should consider including BIOL 140 in their first year at UBC even though this course is not required in the Biotechnology specialization.

 

8 The credit for the work terms is not included in the academic credits needed for the degree or the totals for the academic year. Students must take at least one work term as either a Fall work term or a Winter work term. The remaining work term may be done as a Fall, Winter, or Summer work term. The Biotechnology specialization normally ends with a final study term.

 

9 Some courses only fit particular timetables. Plan schedules to have a minimum of 15 credits in each academic term in the winter session of year four. Students graduating in May at the end of year 5 only need to take enough academic credit to fulfill the requirements of the specialization.

 

10 If more than one of these courses are taken, the extra courses can count as part of the 6 credits of courses from the Biotechnology selection list.

 

11 MICB 448 would normally be 3 credits. It may be taken as 6 credits if the total number of electives in fourth and fifth years is lowered from 9 credits to 6 credits, so the total required credit remains at 42 credits.

9 Students will normally be required to take CAPS 449 and one of CAPS 430 or CAPS 431 in the same Winter Session.

10 Students may take CAPS 430 (6) in lieu of CAPS 431 (3). Students taking CAPS 430 (6) are only required to take 3 credits of electives in 4th year.
The [Department of Chemistry](http://www.chem.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. For information regarding advanced degrees, see graduate [Chemistry](/node/15019). It is assumed that all students entering courses of the Department have passed Chemistry 11 or the equivalent; those who have not must consult the Department before registering.

Students wishing to enter second-year chemistry specializations must apply using the online process administered by the [Faculty of Science](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply). Students will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Students may apply for direct admittance to a Combined Major or Combined Honours chemistry specialization. Due to the similarity between the Major and Honours chemistry specializations in second year, the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to the Major. Qualified students wishing to transfer to Honours or into another chemistry specialization should contact the undergraduate advisor for advice. Students accepted to one of the specializations will register using a Standard Timetable (STT) available on the registration system. The progress of continuing chemistry students will be reviewed at the end of each academic year. Students making satisfactory progress do not require annual specialization approval. The Department will contact students with unsatisfactory standing in Honours or Combined Honours.

### Co-operative Education Program

Co-operative Education is a process of education which integrates academic study with related and supervised work experience in co-operating employer organizations.

A Co-operative Education program is available for students in Chemistry. The program is intended to help prepare interested and qualified students for research careers in industry with sixteen months of work placement supervised by practising professionals. Faculty advisors also visit students at their place of work and provide advice on technical reports required of all students in the Program.

To be eligible, students must be admissible into the third-year Chemistry B.Sc. program with second-class standing. Admission is by application to the Co-op Office in February prior to third year (transfer students may be considered later). Selection of students will be based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as determined by resumé and interview. The total enrolment will be subject to the availability of appropriate work placements and faculty advisors. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between students and employing organizations. Participating students register for CHEM 398, 399, 498, or 499 as appropriate, and pay the Co-operative Education Program Fee per course (see [Program and Course Fees](/fees/program-course-and-faculty-fees)).

Graduation in the Co-operative Education program requires a student to complete each of CHEM 398, 399, 498, 499, in addition to the normal academic requirements. Students will have each satisfactorily completed course noted on their academic record. Detailed information on the program may be obtained from the Department of Chemistry or from the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).

### International Three-Two B.Sc./M.Sc. Degree Partnership in Chemistry

A partnership between the Chemistry Department and select European universities provides eligible students with a study exchange experience allowing for the completion of both Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and Master of Science (M.Sc.) degrees. A brief overview is provided below with detailed information available at [International Three-Two B.Sc./M.Sc. Degree Partnerships](http://chem.ubc.ca/study-abroad).

#### Laddered Degree Option (for UBC undergraduate students)

Eligible UBC students complete the requirements for the first three years of any Chemistry specialization, and then undertake an academic year of study abroad as an Exchange Student at a Partner university. Courses at the Partner university are carefully chosen to meet both the fourth year requirements of the UBC Chemistry specialization and the usual first year requirements of the M.Sc. degree at the Partner university. The UBC B.Sc. degree is awarded after successful completion of these courses and all normal requirements of the B.Sc. During their first year abroad, students may opt to apply for admission to the M.Sc. program at the Partner university and apply these courses towards the requirements for that degree. After successful completion of the degree requirements at the Partner university, the M.Sc. is awarded. This normally requires an additional year of study. This opportunity calls for extensive advising, and is available only to students with high academic standing and a strong interest in research. Interested students should contact the Chemistry Undergraduate Advisor before completing their second year of study.

#### Consecutive Degree Option (for students at Partner universities)

Eligible students first complete a B.Sc. degree in Chemistry at any Partner university then complete a M.Sc. degree in Chemistry at UBC. For further details, see [Chemistry](/node/15019#24903).

### Courses

#### Comments for First-Year Students

CHEM 123 is the normal prerequisite for admission to Chemistry specializations. Students with credit only for Chemistry 11 take CHEM 111 before taking CHEM 123, whereas those with credit for Chemistry 12 take CHEM 121. In addition, students applying for entrance to Chemistry specializations must have completed MATH 100 and MATH 101 (or their equivalents).

#### Comments for Second-Year Students

Second-year course registration in Chemistry specializations uses Standard Timetables (STT). The comments in the Course Schedule associated with an STT provide useful information that students should consult before contacting an Undergraduate Advisor. Students are required to have completed the equivalent of two one-semester introductory chemistry courses. Students intending to take organic chemistry (CHEM 203/213 or CHEM 233) should be familiar with the organic chemistry content found in [CHEM 123](http://www.chem.ubc.ca/courses).

#### Comments for Third-Year Students

It is recommended that students taking BIOL 201 should have completed a university-level biology course with cell biology content (e.g., BIOL 200). Major and Combined Major students normally complete the appropriate laboratory courses (CHEM 315/325/335/345) in third year to have prerequisites for the fourth-year laboratory course CHEM 445. Honours students should complete CHEM 319/329 and CHEM 345 in third year as preparation for the fourth-year research course, CHEM 449.

#### Comments for Fourth-Year Students

It is recommended that students taking BIOL 201 should have completed a university-level biology course with cell biology content (e.g., BIOL 200).

With permission from the Undergraduate Advisor, Major or Combined Major students may substitute CHEM 445 and 3 credits of 400-level CHEM lecture electives with CHEM 449. Honours students are required to take CHEM 449.

#### Laboratory and Tutorial Courses

Students taking any course which has an associated laboratory and/or tutorial must register in these secondary activities in addition to the lecture portion of the course. No exception will be made. Students who believe they may qualify for an exemption from a laboratory (e.g., if repeating the course, or have transfer credit from another institution) are advised to contact the appropriate laboratory instructor directly. Students who miss the first laboratory meeting of a course without having made prior arrangements with the instructor concerned risk having their registration in the course cancelled and their space reallocated to another student.

#### Specific Focus Areas

Major and honours students may wish to direct their elective credits towards a specific focus area in chemistry. The Department has generated recommendations for course selections designed to build strength in a [Specific Focus Area](http://www.chem.ubc.ca/focus-areas). Students are encouraged to use these recommendations as a guide.

#### Minor (1186): Chemistry (CHEM)

Chemistry minor course requirements vary depending on the first area of specialization of the student and must be decided upon in consultation with the Chemistry advisor. A maximum of six credits of overlap between the requirements of the two areas of specialization is allowed.

Students must take 18 upper-level CHEM credits including either CHEM 355 or CHEM 315 but cannot count CHEM 448 towards the minimum requirement of 18 credits. Any additional credits taken to satisfy this requirement may be applied towards electives in the student's specialization.

Biochemistry major and honours specializations include 9 credits of 300-level CHEM lecture courses as well as senior chemistry laboratories. Thus the chemistry minor for these students consists of an additional 12 credits of 300- and 400-level CHEM lecture courses plus 6 credits of overlap.
The Cognitive Systems (COGS) Specialization provides B.Sc. and B.A. degrees in Cognitive Systems via interdisciplinary studies of computing systems, linguistic communication, perception and cognition, from the perspective of one of the following streams:

*   Cognition and Brain (B.A. or B.Sc. supervised by Psychology)
*   Language and Communication (B.A. supervised by Linguistics)
*   Computational Intelligence and Design (B.Sc. supervised by Computer Science)
*   Mind, Language, and Computation (B.A. supervised by Philosophy)

The specialization equips students with the background competence needed to pursue further studies and careers in cognitive systems and related disciplines.

Students registered in the Faculty of Science can enrol in either the Cognition and Brain stream or the Computational Intelligence and Design stream. Faculty of Arts students can enrol in either the Cognition and Brain stream or the Language and Communication stream, or the Mind, Language, and Computation stream.

All students in the specialization must take five team-taught core courses (COGS 200, 300, 303, 401, and 402), as well as background courses in computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology.

For specific specialization stream and admission information about the B.Sc. degrees in Cognitive Systems, see [Neuroscience](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/neuroscience) and [Computer Science](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/computer-science).

The Combined Major in Science (CMS) is a structured curriculum that provides breadth by offering foundational packages in three discipline areas of science as well as an introduction in a fourth discipline. Lab and field experiences will promote experiential learning, providing students the opportunity to understand how research is done and application of the scientific method. A statistics requirement will give students an understanding of basic statistics and statistical modelling. A computing requirement will provide students with a basic ability in computation and data manipulation as well as develop problem-solving skills using computers. SCIE 300 (Communicating Science) will help students develop skills in critical evaluation and communication of scientific issues.

All degree requirements must be fulfilled in accordance with Faculty of Science requirements. Students may, with the approval of the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising), undertake an optional minor program in Arts, Commerce, Kinesiology, or Land and Food Systems in conjunction with the Combined Major in Science. See [Minor Options](/node/15407). Combined Major in Science students are not eligible to pursue other types of specializations.

Courses selected must be acceptable for major or honours programs in the specific areas of concentration packages. At most, a total of 6 credits of directed studies and 6 credits of student directed seminar courses (3 credits as a participant and 3 credits as a leader) may be counted toward a Combined Major in Science degree, but they may not be counted as part of a package or other CMS specialization requirements. More information is available at the [Combined Major in Science Advising website](http://www.cms.science.ubc.ca).

### Cooperative Education

This option integrates academic study and supervised work experience. Enrolment is limited. Second-year standing in the Combined Major in Science is prerequisite for admission. Detailed information is available from the Co-operative Education Program Office, Room 270, Chemistry/Physics Building, University of British Columbia, 6221 University Boulevard, Vancouver, BC.

The [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. For information on the Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, see the Computer Science entry in the Arts section. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Computer Science](/node/15024).

Students who are entering second year and wish to pursue a Computer Science Major, Honours, Combined Majors, or Combined Honours specializations, including students who have applied to enter the Faculty of Science and expect to have second-year standing upon admission, must apply using the online process administered by the [Faculty of Science](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply). Students will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Due to the similarity in second year between the Major or Combined Major specializations, and the corresponding Honours or Combined Honours specializations, the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to either the Major or the Combined Major. Qualified students already admitted to a Computer Science specialization and wishing to transfer to Honours or Combined Honours specializations should apply to the department in April of their second or at the latest third year. Students already admitted to a Computer Science specialization and wishing to transfer to a different Computer Science Major or Combined Major specialization should contact an undergraduate Computer Science advisor for advice.

The Department of Computer Science accepts applications in April from current UBC Science students with third-year standing or higher or students with second-year standing who are ineligible for the central specialization application. For application forms and information regarding admission and continuation requirements, students are advised to review the Computer Science [undergraduate information](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ugrad). The progress of continuing students will be reviewed at the end of each academic year. Students making satisfactory progress do not require annual specialization approval.

### Co-operative Education Option

Co-operative education is a process of education which integrates academic study with related and supervised work experience in co-operating employer organizations.

A year-round Co-operative Education Option is available for students in Computer Science. The option is intended to help prepare interested and qualified students for careers in the computing industry with a minimum of 4 work placements supervised by practising professionals. Co-op advisors also visit students at their place of work and provide advice on technical reports required of all students in the Co-op Option.

To be eligible, students must be admitted to the second year of a Computer Science specialization in the Bachelor of Science program. Selection of students will be based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as determined by resumé and interview. The total enrolment will be subject to the availability of appropriate work placements and faculty advisors. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between students and employing organizations. Participating students register for CPSC 298, 299, 398, 399, or 499 as appropriate, and pay the Co-operative Education Option fee for each course (see [Program and Course Fees](/fees/program-course-and-faculty-fees)). Graduation in the Option requires a student to complete at least four of CPSC 298, 299, 398, 399 and 499, in addition to the normal academic requirements. Students who complete less than five courses will have each satisfactorily completed course noted on their academic record.

Detailed information on the Option may be obtained from the Department of Computer Science or from the [Co-operative Education Option](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).

### Admission and Continuation Requirements for Honours and Combined Honours

Students who wish to register in an Honours or Combined Honours specialization in Computer Science, must seek approval from the Department Honours advisor prior to registering for second year.

To be admitted to an Honours or Combined Honours specialization in Computer Science, students must:

1.  complete all courses attempted, including at least 30 credits in the Winter Session of the first year; and
2.  obtain a minimum average of 76%. Achievement of this minimum does not guarantee admission.

To be permitted to continue in an Honours or Combined Honours specialization in Computer Science, students must:

1.  complete all courses attempted, including at least 30 credits in the previous Winter Session (or at least 15 credits per academic term, for Co-op students); and
2.  obtain an average of 72% or higher.

### Lecture-based courses

In the description of the Computer Science specialization requirements, the words “lecture-based” courses refer to all CPSC courses except for CPSC 436I, 448, 449, 455 and 491.

### Electives

COMM 337 has overlap with some of the first or second-year Computer Science courses and cannot be used as electives in any degree or combined degree specialization in Computer Science.

2 Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100. CHEM 110 may substitute for CHEM 111. CHEM 120 may substitute for CHEM 121.

3 While CPSC 110 is the recommended route for students pursuing a specialization in Computer Science, CPSC 103, 107 may be taken in its place using 2 credits of electives.

4 Students pursuing a Co-op option in Computer Science are advised to also take CPSC 210 in their first year or in the summer following their first year. Co-op students will then be in a position to take one or both of CPSC 221 and CPSC 213 in term one of second year before going out on a Co-op work term.

5 If an alternate course is taken with a different credit value one should adjust the number of elective credits to compensate. First-year physics, biology, chemistry, and mathematics can be replaced by SCIE 001.

6 Students who do not have B.C. High School Physics 12 (or its equivalent) must take PHYS 100 prior to other PHYS courses. Students who took PHYS 101 or 131 may enter the specialization but will need to take PHYS 106, 107, 117, or 170 before the required PHYS 216.

7 The number of electives in each year is chosen to balance the total number of credits (i.e., make the yearly total close to 33). However, since the number of available elective credits may not be a multiple of three, students are permitted to move elective credits between years. Students interested in senior chemistry courses or who are planning to enter a career in teaching are reminded that they should take a second course of introductory chemistry. Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s:  
a) [Foundational Requirement](/node/15386);  
b) [Laboratory Science Requirement](/node/15386#18467);  
c) [Science Breadth Requirement](/node/15398);

e) [Upper-level Requirement](/node/15387);  
f) [General Degree Requirements](/node/15405).

 

8 May be replaced with MATH 200 and MATH 317 (using 2 elective credits).

9 Students with credit for MATH 152 prior to entering this specialization can substitute it for MATH 223. MATH 223 or MATH 221 can be taken in first year. Eligible students are highly recommended to take MATH 223.

10 Fourth-year PHYS electives are ASTR 403, 404, 406; MATH 345, 401, 402, 405, 418, 420, 450; PHYS 400, 401, 402, 403, 405, 407, 410, 437, 447, 473, 474. Qualified students are encouraged to take 500-level physics courses for which they must have permission of the Faculty of Science and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

11 Credits gained from undergraduate Student-Directed Seminars (CPSC 490, PHYS 490) cannot be used to fulfill this requirement.

 

12 Every student must complete at least 3 credits from [lecture based 400 level CPSC course(s)](/node/15415#27131).

 

13 Students who elect to take CPSC 449 must take CPSC 349 in their third year.

#### Specialization Objectives

Mastery of the curriculum will:

1.  qualify students for employment in various areas within the earth sciences, including allowing students with the appropriate course background to register as a Professional Geoscientist (P.Geo.) with Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia (EGBC);
2.  allow students to apply for graduate school in an earth science discipline (depending on course background).

#### Learning Goals

Students completing this specialization will be able to:

1.  demonstrate basic knowledge of either atmospheric sciences, geological sciences, geophysics, or oceanography, or a broad range of earth sciences that covers several of these disciplines;
2.  integrate concepts across the earth science disciplines;
3.  demonstrate an understanding of the varying time and spatial scales over which Earth processes occur;
4.  manipulate data in the context of the earth sciences;
5.  write reports and communicate various concepts and ideas in earth science.
The B.Sc. specialization in Environmental Sciences, offered by the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, is designed to give students a broad perspective on the environment. The specialization concentrates on understanding the major environmental issues facing human societies and it adopts an integrative cross-disciplinary approach to the study of these issues. The specialization provides a significant background in earth, ocean, atmospheric, and life sciences, and chemistry. The core courses, ENVR 200, 300, 400, and 449, examine environmental issues through seminars and student projects. Students are required to select an Area of Concentration that includes required and elective courses.

Students wishing to enter second-year Environmental Sciences Major or Honours specializations must apply using the [online process](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply) administered by the Faculty of Science. Students will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or June. Due to the similarity between the Major and Honours Environmental Science specializations in second year, the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to the Majors. For Honours, students require a minimum 72% average in prior courses for admission, and must maintain at least a 68% average for continuation in the program. Qualified students wishing to transfer to Honours should contact the Undergraduate Advisor for advice. The progress of continuing environmental science students will be reviewed at the end of each academic year. Students making satisfactory progress do not require annual specialization approval. The advisor will contact students with unsatisfactory standing in Honours.

A five-year Co-operative Education option is available in Environmental Sciences. The option is intended to help prepare interested and qualified students for careers in environmental sciences and related fields. This is achieved through a minimum of 14 months of approved work placement under the supervision of practising professionals. To be eligible, students must be admissible into third year of the B.Sc. Major in Environmental Sciences. Admission is by application to the Co-op Office in term 2 of the second year. Selection of students will be based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as determined by resume and interview. Total enrolment in the option is subject to the availability of work placements. Work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between employers and students. Participating students must register for EOSC 398, 399, 498, and 499 as appropriate, and pay the required Co-operative Education fee per course (see Program and Course Fees). Graduation in the Co-operative Education option requires a student to complete each of EOSC 398, 399, 498, and 499, in addition to the normal requirements.

For additional information, see [Environmental Sciences](https://science.ubc.ca/students/programs/environmental-sciences). Please contact Environmental Sciences at 604.822.2449 with any questions.

### Minor (3085): Environmental Sciences (ENSC)

The Minor consists of 21 credits: ENVR 200, ENVR 300; 6 credits from: EOSC 372, BIOL 306, GEOS (or GEOB) 305; and 9 credits from: ENVR 400, 410, 420, 430, 440
The [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://biochem.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia and the [Forensics Science and Technology department](http://www.bcit.ca/cas/forensics) at the BC Institute of Technology (BCIT) offer a four-year joint degree program that integrates academic study at both institutions. Enrolment is limited. Entry into the specialization is at the second-year level and requires completion of the first-year prerequisites listed below with at least the minimum admission average set by the UBC Faculty of Science for transfer into second year Honours specializations.

Students normally apply for this specialization through the [UBC science online second year specialization selection process](http://science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply). Students transferring from other specializations, year levels, or other institutions should see a UBC biochemistry advisor. Applicants should also be aware that most careers in Forensic Science require criminal background checks.

The first year of the specialization is completed at UBC. Transfer students who have completed their first year at another institution may also apply to the program. All subsequent years will be taken at both UBC and BCIT, requiring students to commute between the two campuses (scheduling will reflect travel time). Students must meet the Faculty of Science requirement to continue in this Honours specialization (see [Honours Specialization](/node/15401) requirements). Students will need to maintain a winter sessional average of 70% or higher to remain in the specialization.

Completion of the requirements for the entire four- year specialization earns a Bachelor of Science (Combined Honours) in Biochemistry and Forensic Science. The credential is awarded jointly by UBC and BCIT. Students who fail to maintain the Faculty of Science requirements for continuing in honours specializations, or who elect not to complete the joint program, but who wish to enrol in a different specialization within the Faculty of Science must apply to receive transfer credit for completed BCIT credits to have the BCIT credits counted towards a new specialization.

### Co-operative (Co-op) Education Option

The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology department offers an optional Co-op Education Option for the Biochemistry and Forensic Science Honours Program. The program is open to interested and qualified students and is intended to provide additional practical and technical biochemical and molecular biological, and forensic science experience in academic, public, and industrial research laboratories or law enforcement agencies. This is normally achieved through a period of 12 to 15 months of approved work placement under the supervision of practising professionals. Acceptance into the Co-op Option is based upon academic standing and general suitability to perform in a technical research environment.

In order to graduate with the Co-op option students must complete a minimum of three work terms (a work term being a minimum of 14 weeks) in an academic research, public, or industrial laboratory or law enforcement agency (either at UBC or at an off-campus site). Placements are arranged by mutual agreement of the student, employer, and faculty advisor through the Office of Co-operative Education. Students participating in the Co-op Option must register for off-site placements by using FSCT 398, 399, 498 and, where appropriate, 499, and pay the co-op education program fee for each course. After completion of the work terms, students return to the University for completion of the normal fourth-year academic requirements.

This option requires five years and is not a requirement for admission to the graduate program in biochemistry and molecular biology. Enrolment in the Co-op Education Option is limited; continuation in the option is contingent on the availability of suitable work placements. For more information contact the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/).

Please note that BIOC 403, 440, 450, 460, or 470 cannot be double counted. If a student uses one of these courses to complete their specialization requirements, they cannot use the same course to fulfill their biochemistry research option.
Admission to General Science is limited. Students interested in a broad Science program should consider other specializations, including [Combined Major in Science](/node/15393).

General Science recognizes five designated subject areas of the Faculty of Science:

1.  Chemistry (CHEM 0081)
2.  Earth Science (ERSC 0225) ATSC, GEOS except for GEOS (or GEOB) 307, 407, EOSC except for EOSC 310, 311, 312, 314, 315, 470, 471, 474, 475, 478
3.  Life Science (LFSC 0440) BIOC, BIOL, CAPS, GEOS (or GEOB) 307, 407, MRNE, MEDG, MICB, PCTH, PSYC 348, 448 and PSYC courses numbered 60 to 89 in the last two digits and EOSC 470, 474, 475, 478
4.  Mathematical Science (MASC 0029) CPSC, MATH except for MATH 335, STAT except STAT 203
5.  Physics and Astronomy (PHYS 0271) PHYS, ASTR except for ASTR 310, 311, PHYS 340, 341, 343

For first-year requirements for entry into the General Science program, see [Lower-Level Requirements](/node/15386) under Bachelor of Science, Degree Requirements. Students must register in the courses that are prerequisite to the courses of their proposed areas of concentration.

While there are no specified second-year courses, sufficient first- and second-year science courses must be completed to meet the requirements for promotion to third year (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)).

All degree requirements must be fulfilled in accordance with Faculty of Science requirements. Students may, with the approval of the [Science Advising](mailto:advising@science.ubc.ca), undertake an optional Minor program in Arts, Commerce, Kinesiology, or Land and Food Systems in conjunction with General Science. Co-operative education (co-op) is another option. See [Co-op](/node/15391) and [Minor Options](/node/15407). General Science students are not eligible to pursue other types of specializations.

To satisfy the requirement of at least 30 credits of Science courses numbered 300 and above, the student may select one of two routes within General Science:

*   **Route A.** At least 18 credits numbered 300 or higher must be selected from one of the five subject areas specified above and 12 credits numbered 300 or higher from another of these five areas. Students in Route A will register in both areas of specialization.
*   **Route B.** At least 18 credits must be selected from courses numbered 300 or higher in one of the five subject areas listed above, plus at least 6 credits in courses selected from each of two other subject areas for a total of 30 credits in three subject areas. Students in Route B will register in the 18-credit major area of specialization only.

Courses selected must be acceptable for major or honours options in the specific areas of concentration. At most 3 credits of directed studies may be included in the minimum 30 upper-level science credits under either Route A or Route B, above, and at most a total of 6 credits of directed studies courses may be counted toward a General Science degree.

Students who successfully complete the B.Sc. in General Science Route A will have recorded on their transcript the area or areas of concentration.
The [Department of Geography](http://www.geog.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to bachelor's, [master's, and doctoral degrees](http://www.geog.ubc.ca/graduate/).

**Geographical Sciences:** Students who wish to pursue a B.Sc. in Geography should opt for the [Geographical Sciences Major](/node/15419#22171). The program focuses on the fundamental interactions between life (including human societies) and the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere. Students in the program will build upon a broad base in the basic sciences by completing at least two of five upper-year "areas" in biogeography, climatology, geographic information science, geomorphology, or hydrology. With appropriately selected electives, this specialization forms a suitable basis for completing the academic requirements for registration as a Professional Geoscientist, which is legally required of all people practising geoscience in Canada. Students are also encouraged to consider biogeoscience related electives in other departments.

For more information contact the [Department of Geography](http://www.geog.ubc.ca), 604.822.2663.

The [Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences](http://www.eos.ubc.ca) offers majors, honours, combined honours, and minor specializations in Geophysics. For information on graduate degrees see [Geophysics](/node/15051).

Geophysics is an interdisciplinary physical science of the Earth, the planets and their environments. Geophysics applies the knowledge and techniques of physics, mathematics, computing and chemistry to understand planetary structure, climate and surface processes, and their evolution through time. The specialization provides the rigorous foundation in physical sciences and mathematics necessary for studying or addressing challenges related to Earth and planetary systems, natural hazards, and the stewardship of energy, material resources and the natural environment.

Those who wish to undertake graduate studies or apply for professional registration as a geophysicist in industry are encouraged to enrol in Major or Honours Geophysics specializations, or combine the minor with another science discipline. Students who desire to register as Professional Geoscientists (P.Geo.) should contact Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia (EGBC) to ascertain course and other requirements.

#### Minor: Geophysics (GEOP)

The minor consists of 18 credits, including all of EOSC 352, EOSC 354, EOSC 410, EOSC 453, and two of EOSC 329, 353, 450, 429, ATSC 404. See [Minor Options](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/minor-options).
The objective of Integrated Sciences (IS) is to provide a strong science education with an interdisciplinary component. The program offers flexibility in course selection to independently motivated students who have cross-disciplinary interests. IS may be appropriate preparation for many professional degree programs (e.g., in Health Sciences, Education, Law, Journalism, M.B.A. programs), as well as for graduate programs. Admission to graduate studies in certain fields may require additional qualifying studies. The Honours option is recommended for excellent students considering graduate studies. These students are advised to consult the appropriate graduate advisor in the department they plan to attend and plan their program accordingly.

Integrated Sciences provides:

*   an opportunity for students to design their own interdisciplinary course of study;
*   a degree proposal and consultation process which encourages students to develop their educational goals under an advisor's guidance; and
*   Integration (ISCI) courses to guide students in developing a wider perspective of scientific concepts which cross disciplinary boundaries. These courses are intended to develop a broad appreciation of the links between disciplines and their impact on society. The focus of these courses will be on student-initiated learning to reinforce skills in information gathering, and analysis and presentation in written, oral and visual forms.

For detailed information about the program see [Integrated Sciences](http://intsci.ubc.ca/).

### Admission

Students will be admitted to the major program prior to entering second year and continue in the major program or transfer to the honours program in third year on the following basis.

**Second-Year Integrated Sciences Admission Requirements:**

*   Fulfillment of the Faculty of Science requirements for promotion to second-year standing.

**Third-Year Admission/Continuation Requirements:**

*   Fulfillment of the Faculty of Science requirements for promotion to third-year standing.
*   A Degree Proposal that has been approved by IS.
*   Satisfactory past academic performance and successful completion of the key prerequisites.

Additionally, students applying to the honours program must meet the minimum Faculty of Science honours program [requirements](http://intsci.ubc.ca/advising/curriculum-requirements).

### Degree Proposal 

Students must use the online Degree Proposal. Students must find an IS mentor (see IS website for a list of IS advisors) who guides them during the development of their goals, course proposal and rationale, and approves their Degree Proposal. Students may submit a Degree Proposal at any time during the year, but are encouraged to consult with their IS advisor and submit the appropriate components of their Degree Proposal well in advance of the commencement of registration for third year.

Students develop their own curriculum based on an overarching theme of integrating scientific disciplines of their choice. Normally, the proposed courses will contain a cluster of credits of 300- or 400-level courses bridging the scientific disciplines that the student wishes to integrate. Inclusion of several 400-level courses in a program is essential, since a good standing in these may influence the opportunities a student may have after graduation. Continuation or admission into third year of the major or honours program commits the student to complete a specified list of upper-level science courses. Any change in the original list of courses requires approval of IS. To change their course list, students must have approval from their IS advisor and the IS administration. Students should consult the IS website concerning the regulations for course changes.

While IS will strive to accommodate as many students as possible, some enrolment restrictions may apply. Students whose programs are uniquely suited to the integrative, flexible character of the program, but would not be easily accommodated by departmentally based programs within the Faculty will have priority. In addition, evidence of student independence, responsibility and past academic performance will be considered.

Please see [Integrated Sciences](http://intsci.ubc.ca/) for information on the Degree Proposal process.

### Graduation Requirements

For the IS degree options, the Faculty's [Graduation Requirements](/node/15405) apply. The required credits in the disciplines and the Integration (ISCI) courses fulfill part of the minimum upper-level credit requirement.

See [Curriculum Requirements](http://intsci.ubc.ca/advising/curriculum-requirements) and [Degree Requirements](/node/15405) for details.

### Options

Options within IS include the following:

*   Directed studies. IS encourages directed study experiences for major and honours students (courses numbered 448 in IS or Science departments). Space is usually limited and IS advisors will assist students wishing to apply to science departments for directed study. Directed studies credits will not count toward the required credits of ISCI Courses.
*   Minors. Students may, with the approval of their IS advisor and a senior faculty advisor, undertake an optional minor program in Arts or in Commerce in conjunction with a major or honours program in Integrated Sciences.

### Co-operative Education Program

Co-operative Education is a process of education which integrates academic study with related and supervised work experience in co-operating employer organizations. An optional Co-operative Education Program is available for major and honours students in Integrated Sciences.

The Program is intended to help prepare interested and qualified students for research careers in industry, university, or government settings with 16 months of work placement (i.e. four work terms) in at least two different research areas supervised by scientists in industrial, academic, or governmental positions. Faculty advisors also visit students at their place of work and provide advice on technical reports required of all students in the program.

To be eligible, students must be in Integrated Sciences with at least high second-class standing, and they must have completed at least one semester in this program, which includes having taken at least one Integrated Sciences core course (ISCI). Admission is by application to the Science Co-op Office in conjunction with the application to Integrated Sciences, or in April prior to fourth year (transfer students may be considered later). Selection of students will be based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as determined by resume and interview. The total enrolment will be subjected to the availability of appropriate work placements and faculty advisors.

The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between students and employing organizations. Participating students register for ISCI 398, 399, 498, or 499 as appropriate, and pay the [Cooperative Education Program fee](/node/15554) per course.

Graduation in the Co-operative Education Program for Integrated Sciences requires a student to complete all of ISCI 398, 399, 498, and 499, in addition to the normal academic requirements. Students can decide the timing of their work placements upon consultation with the Co-op office and with their academic advisor in IS.

Two examples of standard schedules are:

1.  ISCI 398 in Winter Session (Term Two) of third year, ISCI 399 in Summer Session following third year, ISCI 498 in Summer Session following fourth year, ISCI 499 in Winter Session (Term One) of fifth year.
2.  ISCI 398 in Summer Session following third year, ISCI 399 in Winter Session (Term One) of fourth year, ISCI 498 in Winter Session (Term Two) of fourth year, ISCI 499 in Summer Session following fourth year. Students will have each satisfactorily completed course noted on their academic record.

Detailed information on the program may be obtained from the Coordinator for Integrated Sciences or from the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).
The [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees. For information on the Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, see Arts [Mathematics](/node/14657). For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Mathematics](/node/15070).

Students should note that the first digit in the number of a course is intended to convey the level of mathematical maturity at which the course is conducted rather than the year in which it must be taken.

### Recommendations

The Department makes the following recommendations:

1.  Mathematically able students are encouraged to take the honours stream MATH 120, 121, 223, 226, and 227.
2.  In second year, MATH 221 should be taken in Term 1. It is possible to take (with appropriate prerequisites) some of MATH 307, 308, 312, 317, 340, and MATH/STAT 302 (as well as MATH 300) in the second year.
3.  Students interested in pursuing statistics to some depth should take STAT 200 and MATH/STAT 302 in the second year. This will prepare them for more advanced statistics courses such as STAT 305, 306, and 404.
4.  Major students should consider taking some of MATH 300, 320, 322.
5.  MATH 302 and MATH 307 are courses which are useful in many areas of mathematics.
6.  Students interested in operations research should take MATH 340, 441, 442, and 443. They are also advised to take MATH 303, STAT 305, and 306, and some advanced computer science courses.
7.  Students interested in teaching are advised to take MATH 308, 309, 312, 313, 414, 446.
8.  Students interested in becoming actuaries can make substantial progress toward this career goal while majoring in mathematics or statistics. These students should consult the actuarial advisors in the Mathematics and/or Statistics Departments for detailed advice on course selection and advice on taking the Society of Actuaries' exams.
9.  Students interested in the physical sciences should take MATH 317 which is important for MATH 300, 316.
10.  Students interested in economics should consider taking ECON 420 and 421, and should consult an advisor in the Vancouver School of Economics for other appropriate economics courses. A joint Major in Mathematics and Economics is available. See below.
11.  In selecting electives, students should consider pursuing an area of application of mathematics in some depth. They should also ensure that they fulfill all the graduation requirements of the Faculty of Science.

1 Including courses as specified by the other department, but not exceeding 30 credits in third and fourth year.

2 Honours students must comply with the [Faculty of Science's honours requirements](/node/15401).
The [Department of Microbiology and Immunology](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Microbiology and Immunology](/node/15075).

The Department offers versatile major and honours specializations leading to the Bachelor of Science. All students take the same core courses but appropriate choices of selections allow students to develop foundations in diverse areas such as applied microbiology, environmental microbiology, immunology, microbial pathogenesis, microbial physiology, molecular genetics, virology, bioinformatics, computer science and oceanography. Eligible students entering second year wanting to apply to the Joint Degree Biotechnology Honours specialization and all students wanting to enter second year Microbiology and Immunology Major, Honours or second year Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology Major, Honours or Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations must apply using the online process administered by the Faculty of Science. Eligible students finishing first year will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Due to the similarity between the Major and Honours specializations in second year the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to the Major or the Combined Major.

MICB 322 (Molecular Microbiology Laboratory) is a required course for the Microbiology and Immunology Major and Honour, and Combined Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations. It is an elective course for students in the Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology Major and Honour specializations.

The Department offers MICB 322 in term 1 of the Winter session and term 1 of the Summer session. All students entering third-year in good standing in the Microbiology and Immunology Major and Combined Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations will be placed into MICB 322. Students are required to apply to the Department for placement in the Winter or Summer sessions of MICB 322. Students are given priority based on their academic performance. See [here](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/undergraduate/application-admission) for details.

Students interested in transferring into the Microbiology & Immunology specializations after year 2 can apply to the Department for a seat in MICB 322. Acceptance is contingent on space availability. See [here](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/undergraduate/application-admission) for details.

The applications will open in mid-April. See [here](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/undergraduate/application-admission/application-forms) for more information.

Qualified students may apply to transfer to an Honours specialization in third year. Enrolment in any Microbiology and Immunology Honours specialization or combined Honours specialization, requires a sustained, annual academic average of at least 75% in second, third, and fourth year of these specializations.

### Co-operative Education Option

This option integrates academic study with relevant supervised work experience. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between the students and the employing organizations. Enrolment is limited. Admission is by application to the Science Co-op Office in February prior to third year (late applicants may be considered if they contact the Life Sciences Co-op Coordinator). Selection will be based on previous academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as assessed by resumé and interview. Admissibility to a third-year Microbiology and Immunology Bachelor of Science specialization is prerequisite for admission to the Co-op Option but applicants can apply to Co-op before admission to the third-year microbiology specializations. Graduation from the Co-op program requires completion of four work terms, the normal courses required for the specialization. Detailed information is available from [Microbiology and Immunology](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca) or the [Co-operative Education Office](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/home/contact).

The departments of [Cellular and Physiological Sciences](http://www.cps.med.ubc.ca), [Psychology](http://www.psych.ubc.ca), and [Zoology](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca) jointly offer one undergraduate degree in neuroscience. For information on advanced programs in neuroscience, see the [Graduate Program in Neuroscience](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-medicine/graduate-program-neuroscience).

Students who are continuing in the B.Sc. program and entering second year and wish to pursue a Neuroscience specialization, and including students who have applied to enter the Faculty of Science and expect to have second- or third-year standing upon admission, must apply using the [online coordinated admissions process](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply) administered by the Faculty of Science. Students can check the Student Service Centre to see if they are eligible to register as at least a second-year B.Sc. student (and thus able to use the online coordinated admissions process) in June.

Students who are continuing in the B.Sc. program and entering third year and wish to pursue a Neuroscience specialization must apply online through the Neuroscience program website for admission mid-May.

### Co-operative Education Program in Neuroscience

Co-operative Education is a process of education which integrates academic study with related and supervised work experience in co-operating employer organizations.

An optional Co-operative Education Program is available for students in the Neuroscience specialization. The Program, which is intended to help prepare interested and qualified students for research careers in industry, university, or government settings, includes at least 16 months of work placement (i.e., at least four work terms) supervised by scientists in industrial, academic or governmental positions. Co-op advisors visit students at their place of work and provide advice on work term reports required of all students in the program. The four work terms are normally taken consecutively beginning in Summer Session after third year and ending in Summer Session after fourth year.

To be eligible, students must be in a Neuroscience specialization, and they must have completed at least one academic term in this program. Admission is by application to the Science Co-op Office. Selection of students is based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment, as determined by resumé and interview. The total enrolment is subject to the availability of appropriate work placements. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between students and employing organizations. Participating students register for NSCI 398, 399, 498, or 499, as appropriate, and pay the Cooperative Education program fee per course as well as [Co-operative Education Program Fees](/fees/program-course-and-faculty-fees).

Graduation in the Co-operative Education Program for Neuroscience requires a student to complete NSCI 398, 399, 498, and 499, in addition to the normal academic requirements. 

Detailed information on the program can be obtained from the [Neuroscience Specialization Advisors](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/programs/neuroscience) or from the Co-operative Education Program.

### B.Sc. Major in Cognitive Systems

The Cognitive Systems (COGS) Major (B.Sc. or B.A.) integrates aspects of psychology, linguistics, computer science and philosophy relevant to examining cognition in human and machine systems. The COGS B.Sc. Major in Brain and Cognition, supervised by the Department of Psychology, emphasizes this interdisciplinary endeavour from the perspective of cognitive- and neuro-psychology.

All COGS-designated core courses (COGS 200, 300, 303, 401, and 402) have an emphasis on the collaborative engagement of students in curricular and research projects. The specialization aims for its graduates to possess the background competence necessary to enter graduate research programs in one of the contributing disciplines, or in cognitive science itself.

For information about admission to the COGS (B.Sc.) major streams, see [Computer Science](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/computer-science#14865) and [Neuroscience](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/neuroscience). For information about admission to the COGS (B.A.) major streams, see [Linguistics](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-arts/bachelor-arts/linguistics#9020), [Philosophy](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-arts/bachelor-arts/philosophy#19110), and [Psychology](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-arts/bachelor-arts/psychology#9034).

#### Specialization Objectives

Honours will provide more depth than the Major. Mastery of the curriculum will:

1.  provide enough biology/oceanography to qualify students for graduate school in either biology, oceanography, or environmental science;
2.  prepare students for employment as technicians or entry-level consultants in oceanography or environmental sciences.

#### Learning Goals

Students completing this specialization will be able to:

1.  demonstrate basic knowledge about the chemical and physical ocean environment with emphasis on biological processes and chemical processes;
2.  integrate concepts across multiple levels of biological complexity (i.e., biochemical, physiological, organismal, and ecological);
3.  use mathematical knowledge including calculus and statistical techniques for environmental set up and data analysis;
4.  use numerical problem solving (using computer programming skills) both with models and real data;
5.  use basic field/laboratory skills for observation and experimentation in biological oceanography;
6.  illustrate the distinctions between data, experiment, theory, and model;
7.  define, conduct, and present the results of an independent research project;
8.  write reports and communicate through oral presentations.

#### Minor (1193): Oceanography (OCGY)

The minor consists of 18 credits, including all of EOSC 340, 372, 373, and three of EOSC 470 - 489 including at least two of EOSC 470, 471 and 472. See [Minor in Science](/node/15407#4953).
The [Department of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics](http://www.pharmacology.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Pharmacology](/node/15085). For further information on other courses within the department, see the [Faculty of Medicine](/node/15219). All students who intend to take the B.Sc. in Pharmacology must consult the undergraduate advisor.

Enrolment in PCTH 300 is restricted to students in the third year of the various Pharmacology specializations. Students who wish to enter Pharmacology specializations need to have completed all prerequisites and obtained an average of greater than 75% in each of their first and second years.

The aim of the programs is to produce a graduate broadly trained in all aspects of pharmacology. The programs emphasize the experimental and laboratory aspects of pharmacology and students learn both whole animal and isolated tissue techniques, as well as biochemical and chemical procedures. Skills that are stressed include the ability to search for information, design appropriate experiments, carry out experiments individually and as a member of a team, analyze data, and communicate and write effectively.

### Co-operative Education Program

The Department offers a five-year Co-operative Education option (honours and major). In addition to classical laboratory-based university instruction, the student will receive 12 to 16 months of work placement (i.e., three to four work terms) in at least two different research areas supervised by scientists in a pharmaceutical company or equivalent. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement among students, faculty, and employing organizations. Faculty advisors will visit students at their place of work and provide advice on technical reports. Work placement starts in May or September after the completion of third year and continues through fourth year.

Students in the Honours specialization will take additional credits in second, third, and fourth years and will conduct a laboratory-based research project for six months (September to March) during fifth year supervised by a faculty member within or outside the Department and present an Honours thesis (PCTH 449). Students participating in the Co-op option register for PCTH 398, 399, and 498, in addition to the normal academic requirements, and pay the Co-op Education program fee for each course (see [Program and Course Fees](/fees/program-course-and-faculty-fees)). PCTH 499 is optional for students who wish to have four work placements.

### Admission

Students must apply to the Department for admission to the B.Sc. and B.Sc. Co-op specializations. Selection of students will be based on academic performance and suitability for pharmacological research. Detailed information on the specialization may be obtained from [Anesthesiology, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics](http://apt.med.ubc.ca/education/undergraduate-program).

The [Department of Physics and Astronomy](http://www.physics.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Physics](/node/15089).

Students may select their electives so as to obtain a concentration in an area of their interest. See the [Physics and Astronomy Specialization Guide](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/undergrad-degree-programs) for an outline of appropriate courses and other information. Students wishing to enter second year in a Physics or Astronomy Major, Honours, Combined Majors, or Combined Honours specialization must apply using the [online process](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply) administered by the Faculty of Science. Students will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Details on how to apply to the different specializations can be found on the [department website](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/undergrad-how-apply). Continuing third- and fourth-year physics or astronomy students making satisfactory progress do not require program approval. Students wishing to transfer into physics or astronomy in third year must contact the Department to obtain specialization approval.

Students in the General Science program are invited to consult a departmental advisor concerning appropriate courses.

A dual degree program in Physics and Education, that offers qualified students the opportunity to earn a B.Sc. degree in Physics (Major) and a B.Ed. degree in Secondary Education, in five winter sessions with some academic requirements in term 1 of the summer sessions. After completing all the requirements, students are normally eligible for a British Columbia Professional Teaching Certificate. Admission to the dual degree program requires application in the fall of second year and successful completion of a teaching practicum at the end of second year. See the [Dual Degree Program in Science and Education](/node/15389#18521) for more information on admission and continuation requirements.

### Courses Primarily for First-Year Science Students

Physics 11 (BC secondary school) or equivalent is a prerequisite for all students entering the Faculty of Science. Students lacking Physics 11, but wishing to enter, should submit a special appeal to Enrolment Services with their application to take PHYS 100.

Science students with Physics 11, but not Physics 12 are required to take 3 credits of physics as part of the [Foundational Requirement](/node/15386). Normally this requirement is met by taking PHYS 100. All PHYS courses require Physics 12 or PHYS 100. Credit will be given for only one of PHYS 106, 107 or 117.

PHYS 106 is open to students who have obtained an A in Physics 12 and Mathematics 12, and who are particularly interested in physical science and/or its application to other fields or disciplines.

Students planning to go into Astronomy, Physics or Applied Science (and some other specializations) are required to take one of PHYS 102 or 108 or 118, in addition to PHYS 119 and one of PHYS 101 or 106 or 107 or 117 or 131. Credit will only be given for one of PHYS 102, 108 or 118. Science One satisfies the entrance requirement for all Physics and Astronomy specializations.

Non-science students without Physics 11 may take PHYS 100 in a later year.

### Courses for Students Not Specializing in Physics

PHYS 330 (3) is primarily for students in the Faculty of Science who are not specializing in physics.

PHYS 340 (3), 341 (3), and 343 (3) are for students not in the Faculty of Science. PHYS 318 (3) is recommended for general science, pre-architecture, and education students.

### Co-operative Education Program

Co-operative education is a process of education that integrates academic study with related and supervised work experience in co-operating employer organizations.

A Co-operative Education program is available for students in Physics and Astronomy. The program is intended to help prepare interested and qualified students for research careers in industry with at least four work placements (each placement is normally 16 weeks long) supervised by practising professionals. Faculty advisors or Co-op coordinators also visit students at their place of work and provide advice on technical reports required of all students in the program.

To be eligible, students must be admissible into the second-year Physics or Astronomy Bachelor of Science program with an average above 68%. Admission is by application to the Co-op Office. Selection of students will be based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as determined by their resume and interview. Enrolment is subject to the availability of appropriate work placements and faculty advisors. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between the students and the employing organizations. Participating students will register for PHYS 298, 299, 399, 498, or 499 as appropriate, and pay the co-operative education program fee per course and Co-op workshop fees (see [Co-operative Education Program Fees](/fees/program-course-and-faculty-fees)).

Graduation in the program requires a student to complete at least four of PHYS 298, 299, 399, 498 and 499, in addition to the normal academic requirements. Not all of the work terms may be in summer. Students will have each satisfactorily completed course noted on their academic record.

Detailed information on the program may be obtained from the Department of Physics or the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).

11 It is possible for students to replace PHYS 449 with BIOC 449, BIOL 449, or MICB 449 with approval from both the Biophysics Advisor and the other department.

### Bio-Science Electives

The 18 credits of bio-sciences in the third and fourth years must include at least one laboratory course from the following recommended list or approved by the Biophysics advisor: BIOC 301, BIOL 337, BIOL 340, BIOL 341, BIOL 351, BIOL 352, BIOL 363, BIOL 437, MICB 322, MICB 323. The electives should concentrate mainly on one of the following broad categories:

1.  Molecular and Cell Biology
2.  Macrobiology (Biology on the level of organisms)
3.  Applied Biology (mainly medical applications)

The student's list of electives must be approved by the Biophysics advisor, who will direct the student to the appropriate Life Science advisors. The specialization should give the student good working knowledge of one sub-field in the biological sciences. Most of such electives have prerequisites; early consultation with an advisor is, therefore, recommended.

The following is a list of suggested bio-science electives:

*   Anatomy: CAPS 390, 391
*   Biochemistry: BIOC 301, 303 (in place of 302), 402, 403, 410
*   Biology: BIOL 301, 320, 325, 327, 331, 335, 336, 337, 340, 341, 351, 352, 361, 362, 363, 364, 415, 425, 430, 431, 433, 434, 437, 447, 454, 455, 458, 463
*   Chemistry: CHEM 305, 313, 405, 413, 435
*   Mathematics: MATH 361
*   Microbiology: MICB 201, 202, 301, 306, 308, 322, 323, 325, 405, 424, 425
*   Pharmacology and Therapeutics: PCTH 305, 325. Only one of these may count towards the required 18 credits of bio-sciences electives.
*   Physiology: CAPS 301, 426
*   Physics: PHYS 404, 405, 438

### Co-operative Education Program

This optional program integrates academic study with related and supervised work experience. Enrolment is limited. Detailed information is available from the Department of Statistics or the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).
The [Department of Zoology](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca) offers programs of study jointly with the Department of Botany leading to a bachelor's degree in Biology. There is no undergraduate degree in Zoology.

The Department of Zoology offers advanced degree programs leading to the master's and doctoral degree in [Zoology](/node/15110).

Facilities are available for advanced study and research in the following areas: aquaculture, biological oceanography, comparative physiology, developmental and cell biology, ecology, entomology, ethology, fish biology and fisheries, genetics, ichthyology and limnology, marine biology, parasitology, vertebrate and invertebrate zoology, and zoogeography. Attention is directed to the following applied fields.

### Ecology

The Ecology Group in the Department of Zoology offers research opportunities at the local, national, and international level in aquatic, evolutionary, mathematical, population, and resource ecology.

### Entomology

Courses of study are offered through the Department of Zoology and the Faculties of Forestry and Land and Food Systems. Zoology offers introductory and advanced courses in entomology and maintains a museum collection and specialized library. Forestry has courses in insect ecology and in the special problems of forest entomology and forest protection. In the Faculty of Land and Food Systems, the Department of Plant Science offers courses in economic entomology, biometeorology, insect physiology, pesticides, biological control, and plant-disease vectors.

At the graduate level, there is research guidance in problems relating to the classification, structure, function and bionomics of insects, as well as in special areas, such as biological control, biochemical genetics, and plant-insect relationships.

### Fish Biology and Fisheries

The Fish Biology and Fisheries Group maintains a strong tradition in fish-oriented research at the University of British Columbia. Studies range from physiology, ethology, biomechanics, systematics and evolution, through marine and freshwater ecology, to fisheries oceanography and management (population modelling, and fisheries economics).

In addition to facilities on campus, federal and provincial agencies encourage research in cooperation with government scientists, many of whom serve on students' research advisory committees. Wildlife management courses of study permitting a student to enter this field of applied zoology can be obtained either through the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.), the Bachelor of Science in Agroecology (B.Sc. \[Agro.\]), or the Bachelor of Science in Forestry (B.S.F.). In each instance the master's degree is essential and students should not attempt to enter the field unless they can meet the academic requirements for it.
The B.Sc. degree begins with study of the foundations of science and provides options for either continued broad study across the sciences or specialization in one or two disciplines. In addition, there is ample room for study outside the sciences.

To earn a B.Sc. students must follow one of the following seven options:

*   **Major.** This option involves specialization in a single field while allowing sufficient elective space for a student to explore other areas of study.
*   **Combined Major.** This option involves a single specialization combining select requirements from the fields of different majors in Science. Combined major specializations are not defined between all fields. Consult the listings of individual departments for descriptions of available specializations.
*   **Double Major.** This option involves two specializations in two fields. Students complete the requirements of two majors in Science or the degree requirements of one major in Science and the additional requirements of one major in Arts.
*   **Honours.** This option usually involves intense specialization in a single field. An honours B.Sc. requires maintenance of a high academic standing and may involve preparation of a graduating thesis. Honours candidates are required to follow the course of study as set out in the Calendar, to pass all courses completed, and to maintain a minimum overall 68% average in each academic session (higher in some disciplines). These requirements apply whether the candidate studies at UBC or at a Go Global exchange partner.
    
    Candidates for honours must meet the credit requirements below both before entering honours and while in honours. Honours specializations that have corresponding majors specializations normally admit qualified students upon promotion to third year (see [Course and Specialization Approval](/node/15375)).
    
    Honours candidates who register for courses in both terms of Winter Session are required to meet the standards above on at least 27 academic credits. Honours candidates who register for courses in only one term of Winter Session are required to meet the standards above on at least 12 academic credits. This provision applies to students who spend the other term on a Go Global international study or service activity or on a Co-operative Education work term, or who do not pursue their UBC degree for one term. Honours candidates who do not meet the requirements above will not be admitted to honours or will be removed from honours at the time of the annual sessional evaluation. If they think they have grounds to appeal, they should discuss their situation with an academic advisor in their specialization before appealing (see [Course and Specialization Approval](/node/15375)). In their last Winter Session honours students may attempt fewer than 27 credits if all academic degree requirements are completed during this last session.
    
    Students interested in entering an honours specialization upon promotion to third year must consult an advisor in the area of specialization before being admitted, and must remain in contact with an advisor throughout their degree studies.
    
    Pursuit of an honours B.Sc. is not normally permitted in a second-degree program (see [Second Degree Studies](/node/15390)).
    
*   **Combined Honours.** This option involves a single specialization combining select requirements from the fields of two honours specializations in Science. Combined Honours specializations are not defined between all fields. Consult the listings of individual departments for descriptions of available specializations. See Honours entry above for general regulations governing all honours options.
*   **Dual Degree in Science and Another Subject.** This concurrent option offers eligible students the opportunity to earn a Bachelor of Science with a bachelor's degree in Arts, education, or music. Students must satisfy all of the requirements for both the B.Sc. and the B.A., B.Ed., or B.Mus. degrees in their chosen areas of specialization. The requirements for the B.Sc./B.A. dual degree option exceed those for a double major in science and Arts (above).
*   **Master of Management Dual Degree Option** This dual degree option offers qualified students the opportunity to earn, in one course of study, an undergraduate B.Sc. degree from the Faculty of Science and a Master of Management Degree from the Sauder School of Business. This dual degree option can be completed in four and one half years through intensive study and scheduling that includes one summer following fourth year. The Business Career Centre in the Sauder School of Business will also provide extensive professional development and career preparation throughout the dual degree program of study. Additional specialized [fees](/fees/tuition-fees/undergraduatemaster-management-dual-degree) for the Master of Management will be paid by all students admitted into the Dual Degree Option. For further information, see [Dual Degree Option](/node/14792).

Although an honours option is often the preferred preparation for graduate studies in some fields, all majors and honours options listed above may lead to graduate study if sufficiently high standing is obtained. For additional information regarding preparation for graduate study, please consult an advisor in your field of interest.

More information on the common requirements of the degree options introduced above is found elsewhere: see [General Degree Requirements](/node/15405); [Communication Requirement](/node/15384); [Science Requirement](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/science-and-arts-requirements); [Arts Requirement](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/science-and-arts-requirements#18441); [Science Breadth Requirement](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/science-breadth-requirement); [Lower-level Requirements](/node/15386); and [Upper-level Requirement](/node/15387). See also [Double Major and Dual Degree](/node/15389). The specific courses required for each specialization (e.g., Major in Earth and Ocean Sciences) are defined in the alphabetically arranged list of [specializations](/node/15409).

In addition to the following one of the seven degree options above, a B.Sc. student may be interested in the following opportunities:

*   **Minor.** An optional minor comprising courses taken in science but outside the main area of specialization or in another faculty (Arts, Commerce and Business Administration, Kinesiology, or Land and Food Systems) may be completed as part of the B.Sc. The minor allows students to focus their electives in a single subject or field of specialization. Most types of minor require 18 upper-level credits but a minor in a specified subject in Arts requires an additional 12 credits in the subject for a total of 30 credits. See [Minor Options](/node/15407) in this section.
*   **Part-time Study.** Some degree options are amenable to part-time study. Students should inquire at the [Science Advising](mailto:advising@science.ubc.ca) for direction in arranging a part-time study.
*   **Co-operative Education Programs.** Co-operative education integrates students' academic education (classroom-based learning) with relevant, supervised, and paid work experience (work-based learning) in employer organizations. In order to graduate in a co-operative education option, students must successfully complete the required number of work terms in addition to the regular academic requirements in a department. For detailed information, see [Co-operative Education](/node/15391).
*   **Study Abroad.** Students may spend one or two terms at a partner university while accumulating credits toward the degree and experiencing a new culture. Consult [Go Global](http://students.ubc.ca/about/go-global).

This page provides a comprehensive list of permitted degree options. Students may not pursue another program at UBC, or a different institution, concurrently with the B.Sc. unless explicitly permitted by one of the listed degree options.
Students are reminded that they are subject to the University's [Policies and Regulations](/node/15610), and are directed especially to ["Student Declaration and Responsibility"](/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/student-declaration-and-responsibility), ["Academic Honesty and Standards"](/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/academic-honesty-and-standards), and ["Academic Freedom"](/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/academic-freedom). For links to further regulations in the Faculty of Science, students should check the [directory](/node/15371).

The faculty-level regulations in effect at the time a student is admitted into the Faculty of Science apply as long as the degree is completed within the normal seven-year time limit (see [Credit](/node/15377)) and without interruption because of poor academic performance. Likewise, the requirements for the specialization in effect when a student is accepted into the specialization apply as long as the student has not been required to withdraw. Students re-admitted to the program after a requirement to withdraw for poor academic performance will be subject to the regulations in effect upon re-admission.

Students are responsible for selecting a set of courses that meets all Faculty and departmental requirements. In all cases, when degree regulations change after the student is admitted to the Faculty or accepted into a specialization, the student may choose to follow the new set of regulations but may not be required to do so as long as the student is making satisfactory progress toward the degree. However, in exceptional cases alternative courses may have to be taken if Senate approves changes to curriculum that eliminate the availability of previous requirements.

Students who have met all the requirements for their specialization will be required to apply for graduation and graduate.

Part-time students are reminded that a degree must be completed within seven years to avoid complications resulting from program changes, or from substantial changes in course material, or from both.
[Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) is a student's primary source for advising inthe Faculty of Science. Staff and academic advisors are there to assist undergraduate students in their general academic planning, in interpreting faculty regulations and course requirements, and in resolving academic and personal problems.

Academic advising related to the student's specialized area of study can be obtained from advisors in the department or program that offers the specialization.

Academic and personal assistance is also available at [Current Students](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students).

### Email Communication

Email is the preferred means for the Faculty of Science administration and faculty members to communicate important messages to students. It is the responsibility of all science students to ensure that their current email address is accurately recorded on the [Student Service Centre](http://students.ubc.ca/ssc) and to read email sent to that account on a regular basis. Free email accounts are available for all UBC students, but any email account may be registered through the SSC.
### General Information

Application for admission to the Faculty must be made [online](http://you.ubc.ca/ubc/vancouver). Procedures, policies, and admission requirements to UBC and the Faculty are specified in [Admissions](/node/15557).

### Admission from Secondary School

Students interested in [Science One](/node/15406#4898) must, in addition to applying for admission to the Faculty, also submit a formal application directly to the Science One office.

Students interested in the Coordinated Science Program or in registering individually for courses need only to submit the general application for admission to the Faculty.

Admissibility is determined on the basis of a number of factors including performance in specific high school courses, the overall academic rigor of the program, evidence of relevant learning and achievements both in and out of school, and other indicators of suitability for the Bachelor of Science program at UBC.

Details are available from the [Faculty](http://www.science.ubc.ca/future) and [you.ubc.ca](http://you.ubc.ca).

Many students are admitted on the basis of interim grades to ensure that offers of admission meet the needs of both the applicant and the university for timely decision-making. Students who are admitted on interim grades and whose final grades drop below the final competitive admission average may be contacted by the Faculty and required to participate in workshops and peer support programs to facilitate academic success.

### Admission as a Post-Secondary Transfer

Students applying to the Faculty of Science by transfer from other post-secondary institutions should note that at least 60 credits (for a Major) or 66 (for Honours) must be earned while registered in the UBC B.Sc. degree (see [Requirements to Receive a Degree or Diploma](/node/15632)), including at least 30 upper-level Science credits for majors and 42 credits for honours. Further, there are limits on the number of credits that can be attempted and an applicant who has exceeded the limit will not be admitted (see below).

Students who have not completed the [Communication Requirement](/node/15384) upon admission need to be aware that they will not be eligible for promotion to fourth year without that requirement being completed (see below).

Transfer applicants to Science must also present the required high school academic pre-requisites, as listed in [Admission](/node/15557). In some cases, university transferable coursework may satisfy these pre-requisites. Any transfer applicant who did not take Chemistry 11 or Physics 11 or acceptable equivalent from outside of BC must have taken transferable first-year courses as a replacement. These courses are critical to degree progression within the Faculty.

A student with unsatisfactory standing from another post-secondary institution will not be admitted directly. Successful completion of at least 30 credits of university-transferable courses at a recognized post-secondary institution with an average grade that meets the admission requirement set for the year of application is required before the previous unsatisfactory standing will be ignored. An exception may be made for an applicant who meets the normal admission requirements for the Faculty of Science, but was given unsatisfactory standing and is not permitted to continue in the applicant's current program or institution because of failure to follow the prescribed program of study. In such a case, the applicant may appeal to the Undergraduate Admissions Office of Enrolment Services.

Students admitted by transfer will be admitted to the year level that is appropriate according to the [First-Degree Promotion Requirements](/node/15388). The Promotion Requirements are based on the number of credits completed (both total and in Science courses), degree of completion of the [Lower-Level Requirements](/node/15386), and degree of completion of courses required for the chosen specialization. Because there are limits on the number of credits attempted before attaining each year-level standing, students who have exceeded those limits without qualifying for the appropriate year-level will not be admitted. For details, see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388).

An applicant will not be assessed for admission if the transcript shows credit but no grade for any course that is:

*   required for an admission evaluation,
*   part of the [Lower-Level Requirements](/node/15386) for the B.Sc., or
*   required for a specialization (major, etc.).

That applicant may appeal to their former institution for permission to reveal to the Undergraduate Admissions Office of Enrolment Services at UBC the grade commensurate with their achievement in the course(s). If the applicant is or was a UBC student in another degree program, then the appeal for revealing a grade should be made to the Undergraduate Admissions Office of Enrolment Services, which will consult the Faculty of Science. See [Credit/D/Fail Grading for Elective Undergraduate Courses](/node/15643) and [Credit/D/Fail under Credit at UBC and Elsewhere](/node/15377#18638).

See also [Transfer Credit](/node/15377#18623)

### UBC Langara Indigenous Transfer Partnership (ITP)

The UBC-Langara Aboriginal Transfer Partnership is a collaboration between the University of British Columbia and Langara College offering First Nations, Métis, and Inuit students a clear pathway to a UBC Science degree with potential access to awards and supports to facilitate a successful transition from Langara to UBC’s Vancouver campus.

To be eligible to transfer to UBC through this [partnership](http://www.you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/requirements/aboriginal-students/aboriginal-transfer-partnership), students must meet the general requirements for admission as a post-secondary transfer student (above) as well as the following specific requirements:

*   Successful completion of at least 30 (and no more than 60) credits transferable to UBC at Langara (within the last four years). For more intormation, see the [ITP website](http://www.you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/requirements/aboriginal-students/aboriginal-transfer-partnership).

For more information, see the [ITP website](http://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/requirements/aboriginal-students/aboriginal-transfer-partnership).

Students who do not meet the program’s requirements may be considered for admission as a [transfer student](http://you.ubc.ca/admissions/post-secondary-studies/) and can be considered through [UBC’s Aboriginal Admissions Policy](/node/15559#14261).

### Transfer from Another UBC Program

UBC students who wish to transfer to the Faculty of Science must follow the procedures, policies, and admission requirements specified in [Readmission](/node/15590) or [Change of Degree Program/Campus](/node/15591#13985).

Students applying for admission from another UBC program are subject to the requirements noted above under Admission as a Post-secondary Transfer.

UBC Vantage College students who pass all courses in any Science stream in the International Program with a competitive average will be offered admission into year two in the B.Sc. degree program. See [Admissibility into UBC Degree Programs](/node/15496)

### Mature Applicants

Science does not accept applicants who fall within the general criteria of [Mature Applicant](/admissions/mature-applicants). Preparatory study at a college, in Adult Basic Education and/or introductory university-transfer science courses, depending on the applicant's educational background and time away from formal studies, are required to provide the knowledge and skills for a successful application.

### Second Degree Studies

Applicants with a bachelor's degree from a recognized institution may apply to pursue a second bachelor's degree in a discipline distinct from that of the first degree. See [Second Degree Studies](/node/15390).

### Appeals on Admission Decisions

Please refer to [Appeals](/node/15561).
### **General Rules on Credit**

UBC awards credit toward the B.Sc. degree for certain advanced high school courses (see [Advance Credit](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/credit-ubc-and-elsewhere#18619)), for many academic courses taken at recognized post-secondary institutions, and for UBC academic courses in any faculty. It is important to check that the credit applies to the B.Sc. and determine whether the credit is Arts or Science or credit from another faculty. There are minimum requirements for 72 Science credits ([Science Requirement](/node/15385)) and 12 Arts credits ([Arts Requirement](/node/15385#18441)). See also the [Summary of Program Requirements](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/general-degree-requirements).

Courses eligible for credit must be numbered 100-499; students wishing to use graduate-level courses for B.Sc. requirements need prior approval from the course instructor, the department offering the course, the Faculty of Science, and the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (see [Upper-Level Requirement](/node/15387)).

At most, a total of 6 credits of undergraduate Student-Directed seminar courses (one 3 credit course as a participant and one 3-credit course as a Coordinator) may be counted toward a degree in the Faculty of Science.

Credit gained from taking Student-Directed Seminar courses may be used for elective credit but may not replace required courses for a student's specialization.

Up to 24 credits of coursework in a faculty other than Science or Arts may be taken for credit toward the B.Sc. These courses may not replace specific courses in a science program or count towards the minimum 72 credits of science ([Science Requirement](/node/15385)) or the minimum 12 credits of Arts courses ([Arts Requirement](/node/15385#18441)) required by the B.Sc. or the [Science Breadth Requirement](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/science-breadth-requirement). The 24 credits may count toward the required upper-level credits for the B.Sc. subject to the [Upper-level Requirement](/node/15387) if they are upper-level credits.

Credit earned through co-operative work placement courses numbered 298, 299, 398, 399, 498, and 499 in the Faculty of Science can be used only toward graduation in a co-operative education program and will not fulfill academic requirements of honours or combined honours, major or combined major, double major, General Science, or minor programs.

Credit earned as an unclassified student does not automatically apply to a B.Sc. program should the student subsequently be accepted in the Faculty.

Students accepted to pursue the B.Sc. as a second undergraduate degree must discuss exemptions based on prior study with [Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) in advance of registering. See [Second Degree Studies](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/second-degree-studies).

To progress in the B.Sc. program, students must meet degree requirements within limits on credits attempted (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)). These provisions are especially important for students with advance credit or previous study at the post-secondary level, all of which (if applicable to the degree) may be considered "credits attempted."

A student who does not meet the graduation requirements for the B.Sc. within a maximum of 180 credits of coursework attempted will be required to withdraw from the Faculty.

### **Auditing Courses**

If a student gains permission to audit a course, it appears on the transcript without credit and the course may not be retaken for credit. See [Audit](/node/15645#224).

### Credit/D/Fail

UBC allows students to take a limited number of elective courses which are normally graded on a percentage basis, for either "credit" (a grade of 55% or higher), "D" (at least 50 but less than 55%), or "Fail" (less than 50%). See [Credit/D/Fail](/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/grading-practices/creditdfail-grading-elective-undergraduate-courses). When a student chooses this option the instructor will not know. For B.Sc. students, courses that fulfill the [Lower-level Requirements](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/lower-level-requirements), [Communication Requirement](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/communication-requirement), [Science Breadth Requirement](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/science-breadth-requirement), and requirements of their specialization(s) are not electives in this regard. Courses not used to fulfill the previous requirements and taken on a Credit/D/Fail basis may be used to satisfy in part the [Science](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/science-and-arts-requirements) and [Arts Requirements](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/science-and-arts-requirements#18441), or [Upper-level Requirements](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/upper-level-requirement). Note that "specialization(s)" includes all specializations a student might qualify for including minors and second majors.

Students are cautioned when choosing courses to take for credit/D/fail to ensure that they are truly elective and are not or will not become a requirement for their degree, specialization(s), professional accreditation, or future professional program. For example, students contemplating a future application to medical, dental, and other professional programs should check those programs' websites for advice.

### Credit Loads

Although full-time students take at least 24 credits per Winter Session, and a standard load is 30 credits per Winter Session, some programs require more. First-year students especially should note that taking more than five lecture courses per term (some may be combined lecture-lab courses, some may be lecture-only) with or without separate lab courses may make the transition to university studies more difficult than necessary. Although the number of credits in the specialization listings for first year may exceed 30, with careful planning and due regard for prerequisites, some first-year courses can be deferred to second year without jeopardizing progress. See [the Faculty of Science website](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/new) for guidance.

The minimum number of credits required for any Bachelor of Science is 120 credits, but some programs require more. Full-time students must normally complete graduation requirements within seven calendar years following admission to first year or its equivalent.

First-year students at UBC or students transferring to UBC from another institution must request permission from the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) in order to register for more than 38 credits. Students who do not pass all courses in one session will be restricted to 30 or fewer credits in their next Winter Session, except with special permission of the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising).

Students may study part-time without permission of the Dean but are required to complete graduation requirements within seven years to avoid complications resulting from program changes, or from substantial changes in course material, or from both.

Students hoping to qualify for an honours option must take at least 30 credits in each preceding winter session and successfully complete all courses.

### Advance Credit

Credit may be granted for some courses in the International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement enriched secondary school programs, and in the A-level (British style) system as long as the required coursework and exams have been completed prior to attendance in a degree program at UBC. Such students are advised to consult departmental advisors at UBC before registering in any second-year courses. Prospective UBC students who have completed or are registered in a secondary school calculus course should see the [Calculus Examination Certificate](/node/15562#24065).

Advance credit will count toward a degree program unless an equivalent course is taken at UBC, but does not count as part of the credit load in the first year at UBC. A student who is eligible for advance credit but who chooses to take an equivalent UBC course and does not pass it may not use the advance credit toward a degree.

For detailed information about advance credit for courses taken in the International Baccalaureate, Advanced Placement, or A-level programs, consult [youbc Vancouver](http://you.ubc.ca).

### Transfer Credit

UBC will grant credit for academic study at recognized post-secondary institutions. In general, transfer credit is limited to courses at the 100- and 200-levels to a maximum of 50% of the minimum credit requirements for the primary specialization pursued in the B.Sc. program.

Credit at a more senior level is possible if prior written permission has been obtained from the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising). Under no circumstances will a student be granted transfer credit for more than 12 credits of upper-level coursework. Although pre-approved upper-level transfer credit may be included in the required credits numbered 300 or above, a B.Sc. program must include a minimum of 30 credits of upper-level UBC Vancouver Science courses required by the specialization.

The limits noted above apply equally to students admitted from UBC Okanagan, although for them, courses attempted at both campuses appear on one transcript, so the term "transfer credit" is not applied.

A student who is eligible for transfer credit but who chooses to take an equivalent UBC course and does not pass it may not use the transfer credit toward a degree.

Because similar courses at different UBC campuses often bear different course numbers and credits, a student who transfers from another UBC campus is advised to consult the [Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) regarding applicability of credits to the UBC Vancouver B.Sc.

The Admission Office provides students with general information about the UBC Vancouver equivalents of courses taken elsewhere. Not all credits will apply towards specific degree requirements.

Questions about the applicability of transfer credits should be directed to an academic advisor in your preferred area of study, who will then communicate with the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) who will confirm the final decision.

Of the courses taken as part of the International Program at the UBC Vantage College, credit for Science and Arts courses and for VANT 148 and 149 will apply to a program in the Faculty of Science. VANT 140 and LLED courses will not apply.

Students transferring to the Faculty from other programs at UBC must consult the [Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) regarding applicability to the B.Sc. of credits earned prior to entering the Faculty.

### Summer Session Credit

Summer Session credit will count toward a degree program, but Summer Session courses do not count as part of the full-time program in a Winter Session. The maximum credit for any Summer Session is 14 credits, except with the permission of the Assistant Dean Students of [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising). It is not possible to take two laboratory science courses concurrently in Summer Session. Summer Session is assessed independently of Winter Session (see [Continuation Requirements](/node/15380#18554)).

Students accepted into the Summer program at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (BMSC) may take up to 18 credits of MRNE courses in a single Summer Session. Students accepted to the BMSC Summer program may contact the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) to have their credit limit adjusted.

### Studies at Other Secondary or Post-Secondary Institutions: Letter of Permission

Students newly admitted to the B.Sc. are not permitted to continue taking courses at their previous institution(s) at the same time as they take UBC courses.

Once accepted to the Faculty of Science, students are expected to complete all further credits required for the program with courses offered by the Vancouver campus or through exchange at a Go Global partner.

A Letter of Permission may, in special circumstances, be issued authorizing a student to study at another post-secondary institution with the intention of later transferring credits earned to the UBC transcript. The Faculty has no obligation to grant transfer credit unless a prior Letter of Permission has been obtained. To be issued a Letter of Permission, the student must:

*   be in Good Standing
*   have eligibility to continue in the program
*   have personal circumstances that necessitate study elsewhere
*   not be registered at UBC in the same term

For the duration of the degree program, study on a Letter of Permission is limited to six credits. A student with unusual personal circumstances that necessitate an absence from campus and who wishes to take more credits elsewhere should present the case to an Advisor in the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising).

Permission will be considered only for first- or second-year courses but not for courses that fulfill the [Communication Requirement](/node/15384), or [Lower-level Requirements](/node/15386), or [Science Breadth Requirement](/node/15398) or are required for a specialization. Permission will not be considered for secondary school courses.

A student who is granted a Letter of Permission is responsible for ensuring that the other institution sends an official transcript directly to Undergraduate Admissions in Enrolment Services. The student must also submit to Enrolment Services an [Added Credit for Letter of Permission form](http://students.ubc.ca/sites/students.ubc.ca/files/AddedCreditforLetterofPermissionForm_2013.pdf).

The application for a Letter of Permission is available on the Science students’ [website](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising/LOP).

Permission to study at one of UBC's Go Global exchange partner institutions is obtained through a separate application process (see [Go Global Student Exchange](/node/15699)), not via a Letter of Permission.
Students should also refer to the University's detailed [registration information](http://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/courses/registration) and other guidance at [Current Students](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students).

Students are encouraged to register on their assigned date of registration. Enrolment in the Faculty is limited and admission to the Faculty does not guarantee that space will be available in any specific program, course, or section. Where the limitation of enrolment becomes necessary, the criteria for implementation normally are academic standing in the preceding Winter Session and grades in prerequisite courses. Students are encouraged to consult individual department or program offices for details of any restrictions on enrolment.

Students may not attend courses for which they have not registered or attend sections of courses other than those in which they are registered.

It is the responsibility of students to determine that they are registered and have selected courses for which they have the prerequisite. Students who are registered on wait-lists are expected to check online to determine whether they have been placed in the course by the department; such changes in registration may occur after classes start. Students may not register themselves in conflicting course activities. Any conflicts created by course administrators must be resolved by dropping one of the courses. If uncertainties arise, students should consult the administrative office of the department that offers the course.

Prerequisites are courses that must be successfully completed before taking a course. Prerequisites can be fulfilled with equivalent courses or exempted with the permission of the instructor.

Credit excluded courses are courses that have sufficient overlap in content that credit will be given for only one course or combination of courses listed in the [Credit Exclusion Lists](/node/15408). Credit excluded courses are not equivalent, so permission of a program advisor is required for substitution of a required course with a course from the Credit Exclusion Lists.

Corequisites are courses that must either be taken concurrently with another course or be successfully completed before taking the other course.

Recommended courses provide background that would be helpful for the student when taking a course, but are not required.

Students registered in any science course that has a laboratory must attend their first scheduled laboratory class in that course. Failure to do so may result in termination of the student's registration in the course. Students who are unable to attend their first scheduled laboratory class in a course must notify the administrative office of the department concerned within 48 hours of the time affixed for that class or have their registration in the course terminated.

In general, students who pass a course can use it as a prerequisite for a subsequent course in that subject. However, departments do have the right to bar entrance to their programs and to third-year courses by students who obtain only a minimum passing grade in their first- or second-year prerequisite course or courses.

After two weeks of lectures, students (full-time or part-time) are not permitted to change the program for which they are registered except in special circumstances and with the permission of the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising).

Within time limits students may [drop or withdraw](/node/15650) from courses using the [Student Service Centre](http://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/sscportal/servlets/SRVSSCFramework). After these dates, students are not normally permitted to withdraw from courses but may apply for Academic Concession (see Calendar Chapter V).
Students registered in the B.Sc. program may not at the same time be registered in courses at another secondary or post-secondary institution without prior approval. See [Concurrent Studies at UBC and Another Post-secondary Institution](/node/15377#18642).

A student who has passed a course will not be permitted to repeat that course for higher standing. Courses in the [Science Credit Exclusion Lists](/node/15408) are considered to be the same course for the purposes of this rule. A student who, because of a change of specialization, is required to attempt a course that shares credit exclusion with a course already passed should consult academic advisors in the appropriate department and also in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising).

A student may repeat a failed course only once without special permission. A student can take a course a third time, but will need permission from the Assistant Dean Students in Science Advising \[Link to: [https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising)\] to do so. Courses required to satisfy the Faculty of Science Communication requirement or MATH 100 (or equivalent) may be repeated twice without special permission. A student can take these courses a fourth time, but will need permission from the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising). to do so. Courses in the Science Credit Exclusion Lists are considered to be the same course for the purposes of this rule. Appeals for further attempts must be directed to the Assistant Dean Students in Science Advising \[Link to: [https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising)\]. A student repeating a course more than once will be required to limit the credits attempted in that term.

### First-Year Students

First-year students do not choose a specialization and are not required to obtain Faculty approval before registering. The Science One Program and the First-Year Focus (FYF) Program described in [First-Year Options](/node/15406) are first-year course packages, not specializations.

Students entering first year and wishing to enrol in Science One must submit a formal application for admission to this course of study by April 30. Admitted first-year students wishing to enrol in the First-Year Focus Program register directly through the Student Service Centre. See [First-year Options](/node/15406).

Students should plan their first year knowing both the general [Lower-level Requirements](/node/15386) (must be completed before a student is promoted to fourth-year) and the specific courses required for the specialization they plan to enter in second year. Guidance is provided through [New Students](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/new). Students should consult the information on [Credit](/node/15377) as well as with [New Students](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/new) if their first-year program is non-standard because of advanced placement or transfer credit.

Students who are considering transferring out of the Faculty of Science after first year should contact the other faculty directly and consult with a program advisor to plan elective choices that will facilitate this transition.

Advanced credit from enriched high school programs does not count as part of the credit load in the first year at UBC but may count toward degree requirements as long as equivalent UBC courses are not taken.

### Students Entering Second Year

Students entering second year by way of promotion or transfer must be admitted to a major, combined major, honours, combined honours, or General Science specialization before being able to register in courses. For such students admission to all specializations is coordinated through a central online application process. Students will receive an email regarding this process in late May or early June, but are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the application process and specialization prerequisites well in advance during first year (see [SecondYear Application](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply)).

Many honours and combined honours options are not available to students moving into second year; interested students should apply for the corresponding major and then consult the specialization advisor while in second year. Honours and combined honours options require students to complete a Winter Session load of at least 30 credits. Students who complete slightly fewer credits in first year may be considered for admission upon completion of second year if they have made up the credit deficit during their second Winter Session and have met other requirements. An appeal can be directed to the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) with support from the honours advisor in the area of specialization.

### Continuing Second, Third, and Fourth-Year Students

Normally students continuing in second year are not permitted to change their specialization until the end of the Winter Session.

Students entering into or continuing in third or fourth year who wish to change their specialization must seek approval from a specialization advisor for the new specialization they wish to declare. (Students are not permitted to change their specialization directly on the Student Service Centre.) Some specializations have limited enrolment and are unable to accept all students who meet minimum qualifications. In such cases, students must apply for admission through specialization-specific admission processes. Consult specialization web pages for more information and application deadlines (see [Degree Planning](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree)). See also the information on [honours and combined honours](/node/15401) above. Changing specializations may result in lengthening of the time to complete the B.Sc. Students transferring into third year from another faculty or institution must seek admission to a specialization through the same processes prior to registering for courses.

Students not meeting the academic standing required for compulsory courses in a given specialization may be required to withdraw and gain entry into another. Specifically, students are required to satisfy a minimum academic achievement average on three-fifths (3/5) of the credits listed in the second year of a student's declared specialization (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)), not including electives or courses taken to satisfy the [Communication Requirement](/node/15384). For a student in General Science or the Combined Major in Science, the courses on which the average is calculated are chosen from the ones required for promotion to third year (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)). At the discretion of the specialization advisor, students who do not meet the minimum average may be removed from that specialization and required to gain admission to another.

Students intending to do a double major in Science or in Science and Arts, or a Dual Degree in Science and Arts must gain admission to a science major upon entry into their second year and then obtain approval for the other major before the start of their third year. A form is available from [Majors, Honours, and Minors](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/types). The form requires approval of advisors in both major areas and of the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising). Interested students are encouraged to plan first- and second-year courses so as to meet the prerequisite requirements for the desired major areas concurrently (see program listings in [Bachelor of Arts](/node/14616) and the Bachelor of Science).

Additional requirements apply to the Dual Degree in Science and Music and the Dual Degree in Science and Education (see Degree Requirements in this chapter).

Students who are pursuing a single major, a combined major, an honours, or a combined honours option may be approved to also pursue a Minor in Science, Arts, Kinesiology or Land and Food Systems; they must obtain approval before the start of their third year. A form is available from [Majors, Honours, and Minors](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/types). Students intending to do a minor in Commerce must apply in second term of their second year (see Minor in Commerce).

Students may pursue at most two specializations, e.g., two majors, a major and one minor, or a dual degree, in order to ensure that course space can be available to more students and to ensure that each admitted student has the possibility of completing degree requirements in a reasonable time.

Unless students are registered in a specific specialization their academic records cannot be adjudicated for graduation.
The Faculty of Science offers the following options for enrolment in first year:

1.  The standard program, in which students admitted to the Faculty design their own program according to [Degree Requirements](/node/15405), selecting both the courses and the sections they wish to attend.
2.  The Science One Program (28 credits) is a unique program that emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of science in a small class environment with a standard timetable. A separate application is [required](http://scienceone.ubc.ca/).
3.  The First-Year Focus (FYF) option, in which students admitted to the Faculty attend a standard timetable of core courses and participate in designated co-curricular opportunities. A separate application is [required](http://science.ubc.ca/fyf).

For additional information on first-year programs, visit the [Faculty of Science](http://www.science.ubc.ca).

### Science One Program

Science One, a unique alternative to the standard first year in the Faculty of Science, is a 28-credit program of study spanning two terms. The aim of the curriculum is to provide a broad interdisciplinary science education for a student's first-year science studies within a small academic community of learners. Science One has dedicated classroom and study space, along with excellent student support.

This interdisciplinary option integrates the essential material of first-year biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics through lectures, tutorials, workshops, and laboratories. Successful completion of Science One with the necessary academic standing satisfies the entrance requirements for all second-year courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics. With appropriate choice of electives and the necessary academic standing, Science One will also satisfy the prerequisites for all second-year specializations in the Faculties of Science, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and others.

Students enrolled in Science One may register for additional credits of electives in consultation with Science One advisors.

On successful completion of the Science One Option, students receive one composite mark for the Science One course and individual marks for electives.

Prerequisites for enrolment in Science One are:

*   admission to the Faculty of Science; see [Admissions](/node/15557);
*   marks of 80% or better in each of the following (or equivalents): Biology 11 or 12, Chemistry 12, Principles of Mathematics 12, Calculus 12, and Physics 12; and
*   at least 75% in English 12 or English Literature 12 (or equivalent). Students who have not achieved this minimum English requirement may still apply for the program. They may be asked, however, to provide writing samples that will be evaluated by Science One professors.

Students who are lacking a prerequisite are advised to contact the Science One Office to discuss their alternatives.

Admission to Science One requires a formal application. Enrolment is limited. Information and the online application are available from [Science One](http://www.scienceone.ubc.ca).

### First-Year Focus (FYF) Option

Students who want to be part of a smaller academic community may wish to apply for the First-Year Focus (FYF) option. Students will enroll in a standard timetable of core courses and take additional electives in each term to meet the requirements for their desired specialization and promotion to second year in UBC Science. Details about the courses offered in the Standard timetable can be found on the First-Year Focus [website](http://science.ubc.ca/fyf).

All FYF students attend their standard timetable lectures together and have access to a study space, creating a smaller social and learning community within first-year science. FYF students have access to designated cocurricular programming such as mentorship, events, and networking opportunities.

Admission to FYF requires a separate application. Space is limited, and the application is designed to help identify students who will benefit most from—and contribute the most to—a supportive, cohort-based first-year experience in UBC Science. Students who have been admitted to the Faculty of Science and wish to apply for First-Year Focus should consult the [website](http://science.ubc.ca/fyf) for requirements. Please contact the [First Year Focus Program Coordinator](mailto:FYF@science.ubc.ca) for more information.

Additional information about the program is available from the [FYF Website](http://science.ubc.ca/fyf).
Formal written examinations are required at the end of all courses and also in December for two-term courses. These are scheduled during official examination periods at term end. Enrolment Services schedules those examinations and makes the information available to students through the [Student Service Centre](http://students.ubc.ca/ssc) part way through the term, at which time students are free to make travel plans for a time after their last scheduled examination.

The formal written examination may be replaced by alternative examination procedures only at the discretion of the head of the department and with the permission of the Dean.

Supplemental examinations and examinations for higher standing are not available in any course in the Faculty.

In some courses passing the final examination, or other core element, is a requirement for passing the course but may not in itself be sufficient to pass. Students may be denied a passing grade for unsatisfactory work during the session or if their essays, laboratory reports, or examination papers are deficient in English. Furthermore, in any science course that has both laboratory work and written examinations, students must complete and pass both parts to pass the course. A student who fails the laboratory work may be refused permission to take the final written examination.

Regular attendance and participation is expected of students in all their classes, including lectures, laboratories, tutorials, and seminars. All forms of assessment, whether graded or for self-testing, provide useful feedback on student learning. Students who neglect their academic work and assignments may, on the recommendation of the head of the department, be excluded by the Dean from the final examinations. Students who do not accumulate a record of satisfactory achievement during the term may be denied deferred standing should they be absent from the final exam.

Formal class tests (often called "midterms") are not permitted during "the two weeks preceding the formally scheduled examinations of December and April" (from the [Senate Policy on Examinations](/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/academic-assessment/use-formal-examination-periods)). This restriction does not apply to term-end laboratory examinations.
Graduating students and students promoted to second, third, or fourth year with a standing of 90% or better in the previous Winter Session will receive the notation "Science Scholar" on their records if they passed all courses completed and carried a course load of at least 27 percentage-graded credits. For students in a cooperative education or an education abroad program who are registered at UBC for only one term in Winter Session, the minimum is 15 percentage-graded credits.

### Dean's List

Graduating students and students promoted to second, third, or fourth year with a standing of 80% or better in the previous Winter Session will receive the notation "Dean's List" on their records if they passed all courses completed and carried a course load of at least 27 percentage-graded credits. For students in a cooperative education or an education abroad program who are registered at UBC for only one term in Winter Session, the minimum is 15 percentage-graded credits.

### Graduation Standing

The designation "with Distinction" will be entered on the degree parchment for any student who graduates while in good standing and who has achieved an average of at least 85.0% on 30 percentage-graded credits of Science courses numbered 300 or above designated as part of the program by the department or, if fewer than 30 credits are specified, approved by the Dean.

A specialization may specify one or more of the courses to be included in the 30-credit average. For all students completing an honours thesis, the course and grade will be included in the average.
### Introduction to Academic Reviews

Student academic performance is monitored closely so as to identify early any student whose performance is likely to lead to academic failure. The Faculty works with individual students to provide academic guidance so as to maximize the chances of all students succeeding. Two kinds of academic performance review take place, one at the end of a term and another at the end of both winter session and summer session. Both kinds of reviews evaluate recent academic performance in light of past performance but cumulative average over more than one session is not assessed.

The review at the end of a term will identify students at risk of academic failure as described below under Students at Risk. The review at the end of each session (winter and summer) will determine whether or not a student can continue in the next session and under what conditions.

### Students At Risk

The following table identifies students At Risk following an academic performance evaluation based on the current academic standing, the credit-weighted average (AVG), and the percentage of the credits passed (CP) in the term.

Co-operative Education work terms are not included in the evaluation. Courses are only included in a term evaluation once a final grade has been assigned. For example, courses for which a deferred examination has been granted will be considered within the academic performance evaluation for the period in which the deferred examination is written. Students will be considered At Risk if, in a term, one of the following conditions is met:

9 credits or fewer attempted

Current Standing

Performance in Term

Academic Probation (ACPR) or Failed already on record

AVG 65% or CP 100%

In Good Standing

AVG 50% or CP 50%

More than 9 credits attempted

Current Standing

Performance in Term

ACPR or Failed already on record

AVG 55% or CP 100%

In Good Standing

AVG 55% or CP 65%

Students At Risk may be asked by their dean or director to do one or more of the following: to formulate an academic plan; to take part in academic skills workshops; to reduce their course load; and to commit to an on-going program of medical care or support from counselling services, the Centre for Accessibility or another health professional. Students At Risk who do not show improvement in academic performance in the next sessional evaluation risk being placed on Academic Probation with a reduced credit allotment or being assigned a Failed Year and being required to withdraw from the University (see Sessional Evaluation and Continuation Requirements below). Students who achieve Good Standing on a sessional evaluation but whose most recent term places them At Risk will also be subject to the terms in this paragraph.

### **Sessional Evaluation and Continuation Requirements**

There are three sessional standings: Good Standing, Academic Probation, and Failed Standing. Sessional evaluations are conducted twice yearly, after Winter Session and after Summer Session if the student was registered. The possible outcomes are listed in the table "Summary of Continuation Requirements" below. Co-operative education work terms are not included in the evaluation. If one or more courses do not have a final grade at the time that the sessional evaluation is conducted, e.g., if a final examination has been deferred, and the recorded grades in completed courses indicate that an unsatisfactory standing is likely, then eligibility for future registration may be withheld until all the grades for the session under review are final.

#### **Good Standing**

Students who enter a Winter or Summer Session in Good Standing and who pass all courses will be eligible to continue their studies in Good Standing. If they do not pass all courses but attain a sessional average of 55.0% or more they will also be eligible to continue in Good Standing.

Students who enter a session on Academic Probation must take at least 12 credits in a session, must successfully complete all courses attempted and must attain a sessional average of at least 55.0% to leave the session in Good Standing.

#### **Academic Probation Standing**

Students who enter a session in Good Standing then fail one or more courses and attain a sessional average of less than 55.0% but at least 50.0% will be placed on Academic Probation.

A student who is on Academic Probation is restricted to taking no more than 12 credits in either term of Winter Session or no more than 11 credits during Summer Session. That student must also submit an academic plan to an advisor in the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) during each study term. A meeting with the advisor may be required.

#### **Failed Standing**

Students who attain a sessional average of less than 50.0% in any Winter or Summer Session will be assigned Failed Standing. If this sessional average is based on fewer than 12 credits and the student entered the session in Good Standing, the student will be permitted to continue under the conditions described above under Academic Probation Standing. Otherwise, the student will be required to withdraw from the University entirely.

Students who attain a sessional average of at least 50.0% but less than 55.0%, having failed one or more courses, will be assigned Failed Standing if they entered the session on Academic Probation or with Failed Standing in any previous session. Such students will be required to withdraw from the University entirely.

### **Summary of Continuation Requirements**

The continuation requirements outlined in the table below are determined through sessional evaluation, with new standing based on prior standing, sessional average, and success in courses.

A student who is assigned Failed Standing and is not permitted to continue will be required to withdraw from the University. See [Advancement Regulations](https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,43,0,0#234). 

Normally, the student will be required to withdraw immediately. However, a student registered in and attending one or more courses will be permitted to complete those courses only if the determination of Failed standing is made after the last date for withdrawal from courses without a 'W' being recorded on the transcript.

A student whose Winter or Summer Session is assigned Failed standing and who is required to withdraw may appeal in writing to the Faculty of Science Admissions, Adjudication, and Appeals Committee according to the instructions that will be emailed. A student who is required to withdraw may not register for or attend courses while awaiting the results of the appeal, except as noted above.

Students are restricted in the number of credits that may be attempted before completing the Communication Requirement, before gaining promotion to the next year level, and before qualifying for graduation. Students who fail to meet these requirements within the allotted credit limits will be required to withdraw. See the [Bachelor of Science Communication Requirement](/node/15384), and [Promotion Requirement](/node/15388). Normally such a student will not be eligible for readmission, but an appeal can be submitted (see below).

A student who is required to withdraw may apply for readmission after one full year, but such a student does not have the right to automatic readmission.

The Faculty committee will expect students with a Failed standing who had successfully completed fewer than 60 science-eligible credits to demonstrate their abilities by earning at least 21 transferable credits at a recognized post-secondary institution and attaining an overall GPA of 3.01, calculated on all university-transfer work attempted after they leave UBC.

Students required to withdraw after completing more than 60 Science-eligible credits may choose to take courses at a college or similar institution, in order to demonstrate a renewed ability to achieve academic success, even though some or all of the credits so earned may not be transferable to the degree.

A student who had been required to withdraw from studies in Science and later successfully appealed for readmission will be subject to the [academic standing rules](/node/15380) applicable to students with Academic Probation standing.

A student in Good Standing may take an [Academic Leave](/node/15382) for one academic year and retain eligibility to register in the following academic session. Students who have interrupted their studies may find that requirements have changed since the period of their previous enrolment. Also, students should note that some required courses are offered on an alternate-year basis.

A student in good standing who leaves the program for more than one academic year and is interested in returning must apply for re-admission. In order to be re-admitted the student must normally meet the following requirements:

1.  The student must be eligible to continue their studies within the appropriate year level standing. See [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388) to ensure that the necessary requirements have been met without exceeding the credit limits noted which would require discontinuation of study in the Faculty of Science;
2.  The student’s academic record must be competitive within the enrolment capacity of the intended program of study and specialization;
3.  The student must complete the degree within the normal seven-year time limit. See information about the seven-year time limit under [General Academic Regulations](/node/15404).

Applications for re-admission should be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Office together with a letter of appeal which will be considered by the Science Admissions, Adjudication, and Appeals Committee. In considering an application for readmission, the Committee will take into account any and all evidence of a student's ability to perform satisfactorily at the university level. A written self-assessment, documentation of action taken to rectify personal issues that interfered with academic progress (if applicable), and a reasoned academic plan are among the items that will be reviewed.

A negative decision by the Faculty on an application for re-admission may be appealed to the Senate Admissions Committee. That Committee does not change decisions of the Faculty based on academic judgment, but may grant an appeal if due process was not followed by the Faculty. Thus, unless the appellant supplies additional information in support of special consideration, the appeal to Senate is unlikely to succeed.

1If, in a particular year, the minimum GPA for transfer applicants is less than 3.0, the lower GPA will apply.
Students in good academic standing after a Winter Session normally are eligible to register in the following Summer and Winter Sessions but may choose instead to take an Academic Leave of up to one academic year.

If the student chooses not to register in the Winter Session immediately following the last one attended, the student will retain eligibility to register in the next Winter Session. If a leave of longer duration is chosen, the student will have to apply for readmission through Enrolment Services; normal deadlines will apply.

The provision for Academic Leave does not apply to a student who is not in Good Standing, or has not met [Continuation](/node/15380#18554) or [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388). For example, a student who is not in good academic standing after Summer Session is not eligible for Academic Leave.

Academic Leave is not an opportunity to take courses toward the UBC degree at another institution. A student who wishes to study at another institution must consult the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) in advance to determine whether or not a Letter of Permission is required.

Any student contemplating taking an Academic Leave must consult an academic advisor in advance to determine how contemplated changes in available courses during the time of the student's leave might affect completion of the degree. Students should note that some required courses are offered on an alternate-year basis.

Students with student loans or scholarships are advised to consult with an Enrolment Services Advisor before taking a leave, as there may be financial implications.
Academic concessions are a privilege, not a right, and are granted only by the Dean or designate.

Among the academic concessions that may be granted are:

*   permission to withdraw from or drop a course after the normal deadlines
*   [Aegrotat standing](/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/grading-practices/standings)
*   Deferred standing
*   withdrawal from the university

For further information, see the University's statement on [Academic Concession](/node/15620). Note the difference in that section between "conflicting responsibilities" and "unforseen events".

Students who are absent for short periods of time or are unable to complete tests or other graded work because of short-term illness, or for other reasons, should normally discuss with their instructors how they can make up for missed work, according to written guidelines given them at the start of the course (see [Grading Practices](/node/15644)).

Students who do not agree with an instructor's decision have the right to request academic concession through the Science Advising. Students whose academic performance or attendance is severely affected by medical, emotional, or other problems must consult the Science Advising as soon as possible, and certainly before the end of an academic term, if they wish to request academic concession. Students absent from formal end-of-term examinations have the responsibility to request academic concession from the Science Advising. Students may not make arrangements directly with the instructor without the involvement of the Science Advising. Failure to follow appropriate procedures will normally result in the refusal of the Dean to grant an academic concession.

Students should be aware that academic concession is not granted automatically even with supporting documentation. Further, permission to rewrite an examination is not granted as an academic concession so students who have on-going health or emotional problems should consult the Science Advising, Student Health Services, or Student Counselling as appropriate before deciding to write examinations. Any student who has once been granted an academic concession should not assume they will be granted another.

Deferred standing may be granted by the Dean if the student has been fulfilling course expectations during the term and obliges the student to write the next scheduled final examination. If the student did not write and pass examinations, hand in assignments, successfully complete laboratories, or is in other ways not in good academic standing in the course, in the term, or in the session as a whole, then Deferred standing will not be granted.

In order to request academic concession, a student who is absent from any term-end examination must report to the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) within 48 hours of the end of the examination. This rule holds no matter which faculty offers the course if the student is registered in the B.Sc. or B.C.S. degree. Untimely notification will not normally be accepted. Students will be required to complete a "Request for Academic Concession" form and provide the necessary supporting documentation, but should not delay in making the initial request if appropriate documentation is not readily available.

For science courses, the deferred examination will take one of the following forms:

**a)** Some science courses offered in Term 1 of Winter Session that are prerequisite to courses in Term 2 have scheduled deferred examinations in January. A student with Deferred standing in one of those courses is expected to write the January examination.

**b)** Some other science courses are offered again in the next term of the same Winter Session or in the following Summer Session, and writing the scheduled final examination for that course offering is normally the required means of fulfilling Deferred standing. Students are responsible for consulting their instructor or the department involved for the date of the next appropriate scheduled examination and the arrangements for writing it.

**c)** Some departments may instead require students to write a deferred examination scheduled by Enrolment Services in late July to early August for deferred examinations from the previous Winter Session or in November for deferred examinations from Summer Session courses. Once the student determines that the department favours this option, arrangements for the examination requires direct communication between the student with Deferred standing and Enrolment Services. Students are responsible for checking the email account they have registered on the Student Service Centre for messages from Enrolment Services. Failure to do so will result in loss of the opportunity to write the deferred examination and, normally, failure in the course.  
For courses offered by other Faculties, the student is responsible for checking with the department or instructor to determine which of the options above applies.

Students with Deferred standing who are obliged to write examinations at the end of the next term or in the following session should count unfinished courses in their workload and should not expect further academic concession if they are not able to fulfill their obligations.

Students granted Deferred standing in Winter Session courses must complete all outstanding course requirements by the following August 23. Students may not ask for a special sitting of an examination but must sit the examination at its scheduled time during the deferred examination period.

Students granted Deferred standing in Summer Session courses must complete all outstanding coursework by writing either the deferred examination scheduled by Enrolment Services in November or the scheduled term-end examination in the course in December. Those dates are the latest allowed but do not replace the special arrangements for some science courses described above.

If an examination is not written according to the guidelines above, the student's partial grade will stand as the final grade. Students who do not fulfill their obligations by writing the required deferred examination may submit a written appeal to the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising/exams) within five days of the date of the missed examination. Extension of deferred standing is not automatic; documentation from a medical or counselling professional or from the Centre for Accessibility, if appropriate, may be required to support an appeal.
Students are required to fulfill the faculty-wide requirements for one of the degree options (e.g., major, honours) defined in this chapter of the Calendar as well as the specific course requirements for a defined specialization (e.g., Major in Computer Science), including all course and credit requirements. At least 50% of the credits required must be obtained with courses taken while registered in the UBC Vancouver B.Sc. program.

Students are reminded that regulations apply as listed under the Bachelor of Science, [Performance Review and Continuation](/node/15380). Choice of option and specialization will be limited if good academic standing is not maintained or if academically more qualified students fill limited spaces.

A major, combined major, double major, or General Science option requires a minimum of 120 credits but may require more. A dual degree will require more than 120 credits but some combinations may be completed in less than the minimum of 180 credits required to complete both a first and second degree sequentially. An honours or combined honours option requires a minimum of 132 credits, but may require more. The B.Sc. degree must be obtained within a maximum of 180 attempted credits including credits transferred to the degree.

Of the credits used toward the B.Sc. requirements, at most 24 may be in faculties other than Science or Arts (see [Credit at UBC and Elsewhere](/node/15377)) and at most six may be numbered 500 or above (see [Upper-level Requirement](/node/15387)).

The requirements applicable to all B.Sc. degree options and specializations include the [Communication](/node/15384), [Lower-level](/node/15386), [Upper-level](/node/15387), [Science](/node/15385), [Arts](/node/15385#18441), and [Science Breadth](/node/15398) requirements.

 See [Honours requirements](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/introduction-degree-options).
Excellent reading, writing, and speaking skills are expected of graduates of the B.Sc. program. Skills will develop from critical reading of the literature in a variety of disciplines; from summarizing and synthesizing the information; and from comparing, contrasting, and defending ideas orally and in writing.

The ability to express ideas clearly, succinctly, and with authority, especially in writing, forms the basis of most assessments of learning. To ensure that all B.Sc. students develop strong academic writing skills during their degree studies, students must earn six credits from the following eligible Communication courses: WRDS 150; SCIE 113; any of ENGL 100, 110, 111, 112, 120, or 121; WRCM 1st transfer credit; SCIE 300 or CHEM 300; APSC 176; LFS 150; FRST 150; Arts One (counts for six Science communication credits); ASTU 100, 101; or their equivalents. These credits may not be earned through Credit/D/Fail standings. Credit will be granted for only one of WRDS 150 or ENGL 112. SCIE 113 is available only to first-year B.Sc. students. SCIE 300 is normally available only to students accepted into the Combined Major in Science. CHEM 300 is available only to students accepted into a Chemistry specialization. APSC 176 is available only to students in the Faculty of Applied Science. LFS 150 is available only to students in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems. FRST 150 is available only to students in the Faculty of Forestry. ENGL 100 and ASTU courses are primarily for students in the Faculty of Arts.

All students admitted to the B.Sc. program must take immediate steps to satisfy the Communication Requirement (if they have not done so with advance credit). The pattern of registration priority by year-level makes it more difficult for a student to register in first-year courses after being promoted out of first year.

Students admitted to a first-degree program who have not met the Communication Requirement by the time they have met the other requirements for promotion to fourth-year standing will not be promoted or permitted to enrol in courses other than approved Communication courses until the requirement is met. (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)).

The following notes apply:

1.  Students admitted directly from secondary school are encouraged to take at least one Communication course in their first year. To be eligible to register in WRDS, ENGL or other eligible courses, students may need to fulfill course-specific entry requirements. For details, refer to the relevant unit or course requirements.
2.  Students admitted directly from secondary school who recognize a need to improve their writing skills are encouraged to make use of the resources of the Centre for Writing and Scholarly Communication in the Chapman Learning Commons. In order to allow time for this work, students are encouraged not to register in more than 13 credits of coursework per term in their first winter session unless they are registered in an eligible Communication course.
3.  Students admitted directly from secondary school who have not earned credit for at least one Communication course by the time they qualify for promotion to third-year standing will have their access to credit courses restricted so that they do not exceed the maximum of 78 attempted credits for a third-year student (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)) without completing the Communication Requirement.
4.  Students admitted directly from secondary school who have earned credit for one Communication course prior to being promoted to third-year standing are expected to complete a second Communication course in the next winter session. The limits on attempted credits in 3 above apply.
5.  Students who are accepted into year one or transfer from another program in UBC or from other post-secondary institutions will be subject to the conditions in notes 1 - 4 above.
6.  Students who are accepted into year two or three on transfer from another program in UBC or from other post-secondary institutions, or who are readmitted to the Faculty after being required to withdraw, will be assigned a year-level determined by the general Promotion Requirements and will thereafter be subject to those requirements. Students admitted after completing a prior degree are subject to [special Promotion Requirements](/node/15390#18497). After the first winter session, each student’s progress will be reviewed and appropriate credit restrictions or requirements for remedial work will be implemented if the Communication Requirement has not been met.

Students should reflect on the skills they develop as they progress through their degrees. It is important to recognize both the similarities and the differences between academic disciplines in the conventions of effective communication and to look for courses other than WRDS, or ENGL (in the course offerings in Science and other faculties) that provide students with opportunities to improve their reading, writing, and sometimes oral skills. Opportunities to further develop strong communication skills also occur outside the classroom, whether in study groups, clubs and other social activities, community service, or paid work.
At least 72 credits must be in science courses. Only Geography courses identified with the GEOS (or GEOB) subject code carry science credit. In addition to PSYC 348 and 448, all undergraduate psychology courses numbered 60 to 89 in the last two digits have science credit. Only the following courses in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems have science credit: FNH 350, 351, 450, and 451. Some courses in the Faculty of Medicine have science credit: all BIOC, CAPS, and PCTH courses; MEDG 410-421.

### Arts Requirement

At least 12 credits must be in courses offered by the Faculty of Arts, excluding GEOS (or GEOB) courses and PSYC courses with science credit (see [Science Requirement](#18439)). Arts credits taken to fulfill the [Communication Requirement](/node/15384) may not be counted towards the Arts Requirement.

ASIC 200 and ASIC 220, which are jointly offered by Science and Arts, will be applied as Arts Credit for Science students.

All MUSC courses in music history, music theory, ethnomusicology, or music composition, and a maximum of 8 credits from the ensemble courses in musical performance, may count as Arts credits in a B.Sc. program.
All B.Sc. students are required to have reasonable breadth in their understanding of science.

For the purposes of this requirement, courses for Science credit are separated into 7 categories by course codes:

1\. Mathematics: All MATH courses, except MATH 3022. Chemistry: All CHEM courses, except CHEM 100, CHEM 3003. Physics: All PHYS courses, except PHYS 1004. Life Science: All BIOL courses except BIOL 140, BIOL 300; all BIOC, PSYC (courses numbered from 60 to 89 in the last 2 digits), and MICB courses and GEOS (or GEOB) 2075. Statistics: BIOL 300, DSCI 100, MATH 302, all STAT courses6. Computer Science: All CPSC courses

7\. Earth & Planetary Science: All ASTR, ATSC, ENVR, EOSC, GEOS or GEOB courses except EOSC 111 and GEOS (or GEOB) 207.

Students in a major or honours specialization must successfully complete at least 3 credits from any 6 of the 7 categories. Students in a combined major or combined honours specialization must successfully complete at least 3 credits from any 5 of the 7 categories.

These courses can be at any level.

Students must satisfy at least all but one of the required categories before they can be promoted to fourth year. That is, students in a combined specialization must satisfy 4 of the required 5 categories and students in a non-combined specialization must satisfy 5 of the required 6 categories.

Students who successfully complete Science One (SCIE 001) are credited with having successfully completed at least 3 credits from the Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Life Science categories.
### Foundational Requirement

All B.Sc. students must successfully complete appropriate foundational courses in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.

Students admitted to the B.Sc. with credit for neither Biology 11 nor Biology 12 must successfully complete 3 credits of 100-level BIOL (usually BIOL 111). Students without credit for Chemistry 12 must successfully complete CHEM 100, CHEM 110 or CHEM 111. Students without credit for Physics 12 must successfully complete 3 credits of 100-level PHYS (usually PHYS 100).

### Laboratory Science Requirement

All students are required to have experience with scientific thinking and practice in a lab course where they observe or interact with the real world. Students must complete one course selected from the following list: ASTR 101, ASTR 102, BIOL 140, CHEM 111, CHEM 115, CHEM 121, CHEM 123, CHEM 135, EOSC 111, PHYS 101, PHYS 107, PHYS 109, PHYS 119, PHYS 159, SCIE 001.

Advance credit or placement, or transfer credit, may be granted where appropriate when the equivalent of any or all of these courses is completed at another institution prior to admission to the University.

Students intending to apply for entry to another degree program at UBC or elsewhere should refer to the entrance requirements for each of those academic units. These requirements must be included within an option and specialization that meet the requirements of the Faculty of Science.

Students are reminded that the regulations listed under [Academic Performance and Continuation](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/academic-performance-review-and-continuation) apply.

### Additional Lower-level Courses

Students take additional courses chosen from Science or Arts as required to fulfill prerequisites for the intended area or areas of study. Regarding credit from other faculties, see Credit at [UBC and Elsewhere](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/credit-ubc-and-elsewhere) and [General Degree Requirements](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/general-degree-requirements).
For upper-level credit requirements, see the table ["Summary of Program Requirements"](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/general-degree-requirements). For the B.Sc. major, 30 of the 48 upper-level credits must be in science courses numbered 300 and higher. Students in honours, double major, or minor in science options have higher requirements for upper-level science credits. For students with a major+minor in Science, or students in honours or combined honours, 42 of the 48 upper-level credits must be in science courses. For students with a double major, or with an honours+minor in Science, 54 of the 60 upper-level credits must be in science courses. The remaining upper-level credits may be in other Faculties, though students should be aware that the maximum total credits (including lower and upper-level courses) from Faculties outside of Science and Arts that can count toward their degree is 24.

Normally no more than 6 credits numbered 500 and higher may be used to fulfill the B.Sc. requirements. Prior written permission of the instructor, the student's specialization advisor, the Dean of Science, and the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies is required. To be eligible, a student pursuing a first degree must have successfully completed at least 75% of the required upper-level credits for their specialization and have an overall average of at least 76% in their completed third- and fourth-year courses. To be eligible, a student pursuing a second degree (B.Sc. or B.C.S.) must have successfully completed at least 15 required upper-level science credits in the second degree as well as 24 additional upper-level credits (in either the second or the first degree) deemed by the Faculty to be broadly relevant to the graduate course being requested. An overall average of at least 76% is required in those 39 credits. See the [Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies](http://www.grad.ubc.ca/forms/enrolment-undergraduate-students-graduate-course).

All upper-level credits are expected to be obtained in courses taken at UBC Vancouver (or an official Go Global exchange or as part of a joint degree). Students who took upper-level courses at a recognized institution prior to transferring to the UBC Vancouver B.Sc. degree need permission in order to apply any of those credits to the degree. See [Transfer Credit](/node/15377#18623).

### Double Counting

Students enrolled in two specializations, e.g., double major, major+minor in science, or honours+minor in science, are allowed to double-count a limited number of upper-level credits. No more than 6 upper-level credits that count toward the specialization requirements for the first major or honours may be double-counted to fulfill requirements for the second major or the minor. There is no maximum number of lower-level credits that can be double-counted since many lower-level courses serve as pre-requisites for multiple specializations. Students should be aware that by double-counting they could substantially weaken the intellectual content of one of their specializations.
Students in the Faculty of Science are required to make steady progress toward graduation. The total number of credits, the number of science credits, and the specifications of the student's specialization (in second year and after) are all considered in the decision to promote. The decision is based on courses completed to the end of Winter Session. Registration in a specialization in second year is not a guarantee of continuing status in that specialization; maintenance of a competitive academic record is required. A student with second- or third-year standing who does not satisfy the following promotion requirements may be denied promotion to the next year level in the specialization and be removed from the specialization and required to gain admission to another. A student removed from a specialization who does not gain admission to another may be required to withdraw from the Faculty. Students changing from one specialization to another will have their year standing reassessed.

### Promotion to Second Year

Promotion to second year requires successful completion of a total of 24 or more credits, of which at least 15 must be science credits from first-year science courses (100 level). Students are reminded to consider the [Lower-Level Requirements](/node/15386) and the courses required for admission to their desired specialization (see [www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply/req](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply/req)) when selecting courses. Students must meet the minimum requirements for promotion to second year within a maximum of 48 credits of coursework attempted including advance and transfer credit by the end of the Winter Session of their third academic year since enrolling in the B.Sc. program. Those who do not will normally be required to withdraw from the Faculty.

Students admitted with advance or transfer credit that puts them at risk of exceeding this limit must consult an advisor in the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) on admission to the Faculty of Science.

Students admitted to or newly promoted to second year must participate in the common specialization application process in May or June (see [Second Year Application](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply)) to be assigned a specialization before they start to register for courses for the next Winter Session. All continuing students are urged to consult specialization websites for information well before the end of their first Winter Session and not to wait until the specialization application period in June.

### Promotion to Third Year

Promotion to third year requires successful completion of 48 or more credits. Specializations may identify one or more second-year courses that must be passed for promotion to third year. See [Specialization-Specific Courses Required for Promotion](/node/15392).

In these paragraphs, the term “second-year named credits” will be used to refer to the credits listed in the second year of a student’s declared specialization, not including electives or courses taken to satisfy the [Communication Requirement](/node/15384).

Students will not be considered for promotion until they have completed 3/5ths of the second-year named credits.

Students in the Combined Major in Science specialization require at least 12 Science credits at the 200-level, which must include at least two areas of Science from their chosen CMS package (e.g. Life Science and Mathematics).

**Students in the Integrated Sciences specialization require at least 12 Science credits at the 200-level or above; at least two areas of Science must be included in those 12 credits. Students must submit a Degree Proposal to their program office by the end of second year. For more details see [Specialization Proposal Guidelines](https://intsci.ubc.ca/advising/proposal-guidelines).**

For students in General Science, to be considered for promotion 12 second-year science credits numbered 200 or above must prepare the student to take required upper-level courses in at least two general science subject areas.

The minimum academic achievement required for promotion is an average of at least 60% on 3/5ths of the second-year named credits. Honours specializations have higher expectations for academic achievement. Some specializations have limited enrolment and not all students who meet the minimum promotion requirements will be able to continue into third year [Course and Specialization Approval](/node/15375)). Students should develop alternative academic plans to ensure a smooth transition should a change of academic direction be required.

A student who has completed all of the second year named credits and has not obtained the minimum academic achievement required for promotion in that specialization on their best 3/5ths of those credits will be removed from that specialization and required to gain admission to another specialization before they can be considered for promotion.

A student who has completed at least 1/3 of the second-year named credits and has an average of less than 60% on those credits will be blocked from registration and will require the permission of the specialization advisor to continue in the specialization.

Students must meet the minimum requirements for promotion to third year in a B.Sc. specialization within a maximum of 78 credits of coursework attempted or be required to withdraw from the Faculty.

### Promotion to Fourth Year

Promotion to fourth year requires successful completion of a total of 72 or more credits. Of these, 50 or more credits must be science credits, including:

(1) all of the Faculty of Science [Lower-Level Requirements](/node/15386);

(2) at least all but one of the courses required to satisfy the Science Breadth Requirement;(3) all required courses specified in the first and second years by the specialization (but not all general electives); and(4) at least 40% of the credits specified in the upper years by the specialization.In addition, the Communication Requirement must be complete.Students who go on a Go Global exchange or who have completed at least one co-op work term will be promoted if they meet the other requirements and have gained at least one-third of the credits specified in the upper years.

Specializations may identify one or more upper-level courses that must be passed for promotion to fourth year. See [Specialization-Specific Courses Required for Promotion to Year 3 or Year 4](/node/15392). In exceptional circumstances, a student who does not meet the promotion requirements may be removed from the specialization. A student must meet the minimum requirements for promotion to fourth year in a B.Sc. specialization within a maximum of 108 credits of coursework attempted. Registration controls will be imposed on students who approach that limit without having completed the Communication Requirement. Students who reach the credit limit without meeting the requirements will be required to withdraw from the Faculty.
As described in the [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388) section, specializations may identify one or more specific courses that must be completed in order to be eligible for promotion to year 3 or year 4. The year 3 and year 4 course lists specified for each specialization in the following table do not provide an exhaustive summary of promotion requirements. For a complete summary consult [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388).

### Double Major in Science

Students who are approved in this double major option must satisfy all degree requirements of one specialization, including all Faculty of Science B.Sc. requirements. It may be possible to satisfy the [Breadth Requirement](/node/15398), in part or whole, with the additional science courses taken for the second major. As far as the second major is concerned a student need only satisfy all specialization requirements at the 300-level or higher, and any lower-level requirements of that major that are not part of the first major.

Students intending to major in two areas must discuss their plan with academic advisors in both majors, preferably before the end of their first Winter Session, but definitely before the end of second year. Students contemplating a double major should endeavour to satisfy course prerequisites for both departments in their first two years. Normally students will be registered in the first major during second year and will apply to add the second major during second year (see the application form at [Majors, Honours, and Minors](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/types)). All double major options need the approval of advisors in both majors and the Director of the Science Advising. Applications will not be accepted once the student has gained fourth-year standing.

Entry into and continuation in a double major option requires that the student remain in good academic standing with an average of at least a C (60%) in each term.

No more than six upper-level credits that count toward the core requirements for the first major may be double-counted to fulfill requirements for the second major. See [Double Counting](/node/15387#18669) and [General Degree Requirements](/node/15405).

Students should be aware that in most cases it will not be possible to complete a double major in four years.

### Double Major In Science and Arts

Students who are approved in this double major option must satisfy all degree requirements for a B.Sc. major in one specialization, including all Faculty of Science B.Sc. requirements. As far as the Arts major is concerned, a student need only satisfy the remaining requirements for the B.A. major (i.e., at least 42 and not more than 60 Arts credits in one subject or field of specialization, including at least 30 upper-level credits). Arts courses may satisfy requirements for the B.Sc. Students should endeavour to satisfy lower-level course prerequisites for both majors in their first two years.

All double major options need the approval of advisors in both majors and the Director of the Science Advising (see the [application form](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/types)). Applications will not be accepted before the student is established in a B.Sc. major in second year and will not be accepted once the student has gained fourth-year standing. Entry into, and continuation in, a double major option requires that the student remain in good academic standing with an average of at least a C (60%) in each term.

Students completing a B.Sc. major in one of the following disciplines may not also complete a B.A. major in the same field of major: behavioural neuroscience (psychology), cognitive systems, computer science, geographical sciences (geography), mathematics, mathematical sciences, mathematics and economics, and statistics and economics.

The B.A. Major in Music is available as a second major for a B.Sc. student, but it has limited access to performance courses. The Bachelor of Music is available through the Dual Degree Program in Science and Music.

### Double Major In Science and Fine Arts

Students who are approved in this double major option must satisfy all degree requirements for a B.Sc. major in one specialization, including all Faculty of Science B.Sc. requirements. As far as the Fine Arts major is concerned, a student need only satisfy the remaining requirements for the B.F.A. major (i.e., at least 39 Bachelor of Fine Arts credits in one subject or field of specialization, including at least 30 upper-level credits).

Students should endeavour to satisfy lower-level course prerequisites for both majors in their first two years. Fine Arts courses may satisfy requirements for the B.Sc.

All double major options need the approval of advisors in both majors and the Director of the Science Advising (see the [application form](http://science.ubc.ca/students/degree/types)). Applications will not be accepted before the student is established in a B.Sc. major in second year and will not be accepted once the student has gained fourth-year standing. Entry into, and continuation in, a double major option requires that the student remain in good academic standing with an average of at least a C (60%) in each term.

### Dual Degree in Science and Arts

This option offers qualified students the opportunity to earn a B.Sc. and a B.A. degree concurrently in most combinations of one science specialization and one Arts specialization. Most combinations can be completed in from four and one-half to five and one-half Winter Sessions. Students will not be adjudicated for graduation for one degree before requirements for both are complete.

#### Program Preparation

It is essential that students create a coherent academic plan prior to application. The Faculty of Arts may have specific requirements for admission and interested students should seek academic advising from both the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Arts before applying. Students seeking admission to the Dual Degree option should plan to satisfy lower-level course requirements for both degrees in their first two years, and should consult an academic advisor at least once annually.

#### Admission and Continuation

Applications will not be accepted before the student is established in a B.Sc. Major in second year and will not be accepted once the student has gained fourth-year standing. Admission to, and continued enrolment in, the Dual Degree requires maintenance of good academic standing and an average of at least a B- (68%) in each session. Admission to specializations within Science and Arts may be competitive and may require a separate application process. Admission to the Dual Degree option does not imply further admission to particular specializations. The Dual Degree option is not open to students with a previous degree. The application for admission to the option can be found on the Science [website](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/dual). Acceptance will be based on a review of both the applicant's transcript and a statement of academic purpose.

Students admitted to the Dual Degree program must complete a minimum of 144 credits, including at least 72 Science credits and at least 72 Arts credits. Both degrees must be completed within 180 attempted credits, including failures, and in no more than seven years of study, including Co-op terms and/or Go Global exchange.

Students must satisfy all faculty requirements for each degree as well as requirements for one specialization in the B.Sc. and one specialization in the B.A. degrees. Students may select one Science specialization at the Major, Honours, Combined Major or Combined Honours level and one Arts specialization at the Major or Honours level, but may not pursue additional specializations (e.g., a second major or a minor) in either Faculty. Individual courses may be considered to satisfy requirements for both specializations.

NOTE: Students pursuing a B.Sc. in one of the following disciplines may not also pursue a B.A. in the same field: behavioural neuroscience (psychology), cognitive systems, computer science, geographical sciences (geography), mathematics, and mathematical sciences. Students pursuing a B.Sc. Combined Major in Mathematics and Economics or Statistics and Economics may not also pursue a B.A. in Economics. Students pursuing a B.Sc. in Cognitive Systems (Computational Intelligence and Design or Cognition and Brain streams) will normally not be permitted to pursue a B.A. in any of the disciplines that together form the Cognitive Systems program (i.e., computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology).

#### Recognition of Academic Achievement

The Faculty of Science recognizes academic achievement in winter session at two levels, [Dean’s Honour and Science Scholar](/node/15379).

To assess a student’s eligibility for Dean’s Honour or Science Scholar designation in the B.Sc. or Dean’s List in the B.A. in the Dual Degree option, each Faculty will calculate the student’s average for Winter Session in two steps, using only percentage-graded credits. For the first calculation, the Faculty will use all credits registered under its own degree code, which must total no fewer than 12 credits, as well as the best credits registered under the other Faculty’s degree code. Together these must total no fewer than 27 credits, and the average earned must meet the minimum required for a particular standing in that Faculty’s degree program. If this standard is met, the Faculty will then calculate the student’s average using only those credits registered under its degree code. If this average also meets the minimum average required in that degree program, the appropriate notation will be made on the record. If either of these standards is not met, the notation will not be listed for the session under that degree. It is possible to earn a notation under either or both degrees in a single Winter Session and the recognition may be at different levels in the two degrees. Consult the relevant section in each Faculty for specific requirements.

### Dual Degree in Science and Education

This concurrent option offers capable students in eligible specializations the opportunity to earn a Bachelor of Science degree (B.Sc., Major) and a Bachelor of Education degree (B.Ed.) in Secondary Education concurrently in five years. After completing all the requirements, students are normally eligible for a British Columbia Professional Teaching Certificate. Students must satisfy all of the degree and specialization requirements for both the major in the Bachelor of Science and the Bachelor of Education Secondary program. Some individual courses may be considered to satisfy requirements for both degrees. Students will not be adjudicated for graduation for one degree before requirements for both are complete.

The Dual Degree in Science and Education is currently open only to students pursuing a major in mathematics or physics. For detailed descriptions of specialization requirements consult the [Mathematics](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/mathematics) or [Physics](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/physics) listings.

The Dual Degree option is not open to students with a previous degree.

Students must communicate with an advisor in the [Science Advising](../../index.cfm%EF%B9%96tree=12,215,410,405.html) and the [Teacher Education Office](http://teach.educ.ubc.ca/) annually after admission to the program to discuss their progress.

#### Admission

Application for admission can be found on the [Science website](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/dual). Students apply in the fall of second year after gaining admission to the appropriate major program in Science and must receive approval from the Faculties of Science and Education. All students will initially be accepted on a provisional basis. Admission will be confirmed only after successful completion of year two and successful completion of the in-school practicum in May following second year. A criminal records check is required of all teacher candidates admitted to the B.Ed. program.

Admission at any time is conditional; maintenance of good academic standing and an average of at least 65% in each session are required throughout. Students who do not maintain a 65% average will be required to withdraw from Education, but may continue with the B.Sc. Major if they meet the continuation requirements.

### Dual Degree in Science and Music

This option offers capable students the opportunity to earn a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Music degree concurrently in most combinations of one Science (B.Sc.) major and one Music (B.Mus.) major. Most combinations can be completed in six winter sessions. Students will not be adjudicated for graduation for one degree before requirements for both are complete.

Admission to the B.Mus. program requires an audition. Interested B.Sc. students must consult a senior advisor in the School of Music at the time of application to UBC. Admitted B.Sc. students who are recommended by the School of Music may find the application for admission to the Dual Degree option on the [Science website](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/dual).

Acceptance into the option will be based on the recommendation from the School of Music and a review of both the applicant's transcript and a statement of academic purpose.

Registered first- or second-year B.Sc. students may apply to the Dual Degree option but they must meet the admission requirements of the School of Music. Applications from students with a higher year standing will not be considered.

Admission to specializations within Science and Music may be competitive and admission to the Dual Degree option does not imply future admission to particular specializations.

The Dual Degree option is not open to students with a previous degree.

Admission at any time is conditional; maintenance of good academic standing and at least a 68% (B-) average in each term are required throughout. Students must satisfy all of the degree and specialization requirements for both the major in the Bachelor of Science and the major in the Bachelor of Music. Individual courses may be considered to satisfy requirements for both degrees; MUSC courses may satisfy the Arts and Breadth requirements for the B.Sc. major program. MUSC courses numbered below 300 may not count toward the upper-level credit requirement for the B.Sc. program.

Students should endeavour to satisfy lower-level course prerequisites for both specializations in their first two years. Students must communicate with an advisor in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) prior to enrolling in their first year of courses and at least annually thereafter.
Students who wish to focus their electives may, with the approval of the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising), undertake an optional minor specialization concurrently with their first specialization (major, honours, combined major, combined honours, and General Science except as noted below for specific minors). Applications will not be accepted once the student has gained fourth-year standing; some minors have further restrictions (see below). The designation of the minor will be applied to the transcript upon graduation if permission has been granted and the requirements are met. Permission to pursue a minor will be denied if the student is not making good progress in the primary specialization or if the student is already approved to pursue another minor, a double major, or dual degree.

The following minors are available: Minor in Land and Food Systems, Minor in Arts, Minor in Commerce, Minor in Kinesiology, and Minor in Science. Entry into and continuation in a minor option requires that the student remains in [Good Standing](/node/15380#18556). Where space in courses required for a minor is limited, students may be required to maintain a sessional average higher than the minimum for Good Standing. Information on minor specializations is also available from the [Faculty](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/minors).

### Minor in Land and Food Systems

The Faculty of Land and Food Systems offers several optional minors for B.Sc. students. Upon completion of one of the following minor options, the notation "Minor in \[Subject\]" will be denoted on the student's transcript.

The Minor (3250): Applied Animal Biology consists of 18 credits selected from APBI 311 (BIOL 364), 312, 314, 315, 316, 319, 327 (BIOL 327), 398, 410, 411, 413, 414, 415, 416, 418, 419, 427 (BIOL 411), 496.

An application form may be obtained from [Science Advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) or from the [Faculty of Science website](//science.ubc.ca/students/degree/types).

Space in many science and land and food systems courses is limited. Admission to a land and food systems minor does not guarantee access to courses agreed upon for the minor.

### Minor in Arts

An acceptable minor must comprise courses in the Faculty of Arts that are for credit toward a B.A. and consists of 18 upper-level credits in a single subject. An application form may be obtained from [Science Advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising). Students should design a coherent and academically sound course of studies for their proposed minor, which must be approved by the Assistant Dean Students in Science Advising while the student is registered in second year. All courses must be acceptable for a B.A. major in the proposed subject area or field, but a student is not bound by the other requirements that the Faculty of Arts sets for a major or minor in the field. The following restrictions should be noted.

An Arts minor in mathematics or computer science may not be undertaken by students in the Faculty of Science. Students majoring in one of the earth science specializations (Earth and Ocean Science, Geographical Sciences, Geology, Geophysics, Oceanography) may not undertake a Minor in Geography other than the Minor in Geographic Information Science and Geographical Computation (GIS&GC). Students in the B.Sc. specialization in Behavioural Neuroscience may not undertake an Arts Minor in Psychology; other students intending to complete the Arts Minor in Psychology must follow the requirements for this minor listed on the Behavioural Neuroscience [page](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/behavioural-neuroscience).

Upon successful completion of the minor program, the notation, "Minor in Arts" will be denoted on the student's transcript. Students wanting a subject-designated minor may also undertake a minor in a specific Arts discipline [Minor Program](/node/14620#16812), which requires the completion of at least 30 credits in a single subject field or specialization, of which at least 18 must be numbered 300 or higher.

The Faculty of Arts offers some interdisciplinary 30-credit minors for which no corresponding major exists. Science students may apply to pursue one of those minors only if the courses chosen do not leave the student deficient in Arts credits, in excess of the limit of 24 credits from faculties other than Science or Arts, or in excess of the allowable total attempted credits for the degree.

### Minor in Commerce

The minor is intended to be completed over two winter sessions. Enrolment in this program is strictly limited.

At the time of application, students must be eligible to enter second-year in the Faculty of Science the following September and have an average of at least 60% in all previous sessions. Meeting the stated requirements does not guarantee admission into the program. An application form may be obtained from [Science Advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) or from the [Faculty of Science website](http://science.ubc.ca/students/degree/types). The completed form must be returned no later than May 15.

Applicants must have successfully completed one of MATH 100, 102, 104, 120, 180, 184, or Science One and both ECON 310 and 311 (or 101 and 102). The program will consist of COMR 329(3), COMR 457(3), COMR 465(3), COMR 473(3), COMR 493(3), and one of COMR 398(3) or COMR 458(3) for a total of 18 credits.

**Note:** Students may encounter difficulty fitting the COMR courses into their Science program timetable; careful planning is essential. Upon successful completion of this program, the notation "Minor in Commerce" will be placed on the student's transcript.

### Minor in Kinesiology

Enrolment in this specialization is strictly limited. An application form may be obtained from [Science Advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) and the form must be returned no later than May 15.

At the time of application, students must have completed PHYS 100 or 101, be eligible for third-year standing in the Faculty of Science, have achieved an average of at least 68% in each of the previous two years, and be eligible to enroll in either CAPS 301 or both BIOL 363 and 364. Meeting the stated application requirements does not guarantee admission into the specialization.

The specialization will consist of:Either CAPS 301 or both BIOL 363 and 364, and 18 credits selected from the following list of courses:

KIN 311 or KIN 330, KIN 313 or KIN 389, KIN 316 or KIN 351, KIN 320 or KIN 303, KIN 321 or KIN 469, KIN 322 or KIN 361, KIN 335 or KIN 375, KIN 411 or KIN 473, KIN 420 or KIN 461, KIN 424 or KIN 471, KIN 432 or KIN 489a, KIN 435 or KIN 475, KIN 438 or KIN 462, KIN 459 or KIN 489x, KIN 464(3).
### Requirements for the Bachelor of Science

Students with a recognized undergraduate degree may be eligible to pursue a B.Sc. as a second degree if they have a focus of study that is distinct from the discipline(s) of the first degree. The pursuit of honours, combined honours, double major, dual degree, or minor options during a second degree is not permitted unless the student begins studies at the first-year level. Students wishing to take courses prerequisite to another program should consider instead [Unclassified studies](/admissions/classification-students).

For a second degree, students must satisfy all Faculty and specialization requirements with a combination of first and second-degree credits and must earn a minimum of 50% of the credits required while enrolled at UBC Vancouver in their second-degree program. For the B.Sc., this will mean earning at least 60 new credits; more will likely be required if the Lower-level Requirements of the B.Sc. were not fulfilled with first-degree studies. It is expected that the Science [Upper-Level Requirements](https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,1466), which include at least 30 upper-level Science credits and at least 48 upper-level credits in total, will be completed with second degree courses.

Courses used to fulfill requirements for a prior degree or earned subsequently (e.g., through Unclassified study) may exempt the student from equivalent courses required for the second degree, but will not normally reduce the minimum credit requirements.

The Faculty reserves the right not to grant exemptions if the course(s) in question were completed more than five years prior to starting the second-degree B.Sc. program and only in exceptional cases will exemptions be granted if courses were completed more than ten years prior.

Transfer credit is not assigned to second-degree students. Only with approval of the Director of Science Student Services and the Advisor for the specialization being pursued will any credits earned before entering the second-degree B.Sc. be applied to its credit requirements. Those credits must have been earned in the previous five years and must not have been used to fulfill requirements of any credential. With approval, a maximum of 12 such credits that are relevant to the second-degree program may be applied and of those, at most six may be upper-level (i.e., 300- level and higher).

Students admitted to a second degree must consult [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) and appropriate departments regarding specific second degree requirements prior to commencing the program.

Students are expected to complete a second degree in a timely manner. A part-time study program must be approved in advance by [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising).

### Communication Requirement

All B.Sc. students must complete the [Communication Requirement](/node/15384). Students uncertain whether prior study satisfies this requirement should enquire at [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising). After the first Winter session, each student’s progress will be reviewed and appropriate credit restrictions or requirements for remedial work will be implemented if the Communication Requirement has not been met.

### Promotion Requirements

Students admitted on the basis of prior study (i.e., completion of a first degree) will be assigned a year-level determined by the general B.Sc. [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388) with exemptions from first- and second-year B.Sc. requirements where appropriate. Students will be subject to the general Promotion Requirements based on the year level to which they were admitted (see below) with the exceptions noted below. Promotion decisions are made at the end of each Winter Session.

#### Exceptions to general B.Sc. Promotion Requirements:

*   Second-degree students must meet the requirements for promotion to the next year-level within a maximum of 36 credits of coursework attempted after admission to the second degree program. Those who do not will be required to withdraw from the Faculty. After the first promotion, students will be subject to the general B.Sc. Promotion Requirements.
*   For determining eligibility for promotion, both courses passed while in the B.Sc. program and lower-level courses passed in earlier study, which may exempt the student from courses required for the B.Sc., will be considered.
*   Second-degree students are permitted to be registered in fourth year for no more than two winter sessions without the prior approval of the Assistant Dean in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising).
Co-operative education (Co-op) integrates the academic education (classroom-based learning) of interested and qualified students with relevant, supervised, and paid work experience (work-based learning) with employer organizations. Co-op students gain valuable skills that help guide them through their academic education, as well as prepare them for future job markets upon graduation.

Co-op is available as a potential option to all B.Sc. and B.C.S. students.

Co-op is optional and supplementary to academic requirements of the degree. Students who wish to be considered for co-op will be selected on the basis of academic performance and suitability for the work environment. To enter and remain in co-op, students must be in good academic standing and be eligible for admission to and/or advancement in their specialization. Total enrolment is subject to the current state of the market as well as the resources available to support coaching and job development. Acceptance into the program does not guarantee students employment in each work term. Students admitted into the Science Co-op Program are required to accept and comply with the [Program's Terms and Conditions](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/students/terms). A Co-op administration and workshop fee is to be paid by all students accepted into the program.

Co-op students will be registered in the appropriate Co-op courses for each work term, once a suitable position is confirmed, and will be required to pay the Co-op course fee (see [Program and Course Fees](/node/15554). The normal regulations governing withdrawal from courses notwithstanding, students are not permitted to withdraw from the Co-op course without permission of the Co-op Program.

Each successfully completed Co-op course will be assigned three credits and will be recorded on the student's transcript. In order to graduate with the co-operative education designation, a student must have completed the required number of work terms in addition to the normal academic requirements of the specialization. Co-operative education course credits cannot be used in lieu of or to complement academic course credits required by the specialization.

To inquire about application deadlines and for further information, please contact the Science Co-op Office, Room 170 Chemistry/Physics Building, The University of British Columbia, 6221 University Blvd, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z1; tel 604.822.9677. Information is also available through the Science Co-op website at [www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).

**Graduate Co-op Options**

Some graduate programs in the Faculty of Science offer [co-operative education](https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,204,986,0).
The Faculty of Science encourages students to consider enriching their undergraduate experience with a period of study at one of UBC's global partner universities. Normally students go on exchange in third year for one or two terms. See [Go Global](http://students.ubc.ca/about/go-global).
Each line below lists courses in which there is sufficient overlap that credit may be obtained for only one selection. This does not imply that courses listed together are interchangeable. Program specifications may require a specific course selection. A student who fails a course may attempt that course once more or may attempt one other from the same Credit Exclusion list, but only once. A student who passes a course may not take for higher standing that course or another course on the same Credit Exclusion list.
