#### Faculty of Science Departmental Guidelines for the Minor

**B.Sc., Science Minor in Behavioural Neuroscience**

**Students interested in neuroscience should consider applying to the new [Neuroscience specialization](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/neuroscience).**

For a Behavioural Neuroscience minor, students are required to take PSYC 100 or both of PSYC 101 and 102, and at least 18 credits of 300- or 400-level psychology courses numbered 60 to 87 in the last two digits.

**B.Sc., Arts Minor in Psychology**

For a PSYC Arts minor, students are required to take PSYC 100 or both of PSYC 101 and PSYC 102; 6 credits of 200-level psychology, preferably PSYC 207 and 208 in second year; and at least 18 credits of 300-/400-level psychology courses, excluding PSYC 340, 348, 388, 440, 448, or 488.
The [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://www.biochem.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](/node/15013).

Students wishing to enter second-year Biochemistry Major, Honours, or Combined Honours specializations must apply using the online process administered by the [Faculty of Science](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply). Students will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Due to the similarity between the major and honours biochemistry specializations in second year, the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to either the Major or Combined Honours. Qualified students wishing to transfer to Honours Biochemistry should contact the Undergraduate Advisor for advice. Only students in the second year Combined Majors or Combined Honours in Biochemistry and Chemistry specializations will be required to register using a Standard Timetable (STT) available on the registration system. The progress of continuing biochemistry students will be reviewed at the end of each academic year. Students making satisfactory progress do not require annual specialization approval. The Department will contact students with unsatisfactory standing in honours or combined honours.

The major specialization provides a strong background in biochemistry and is sufficiently flexible for students to develop their interests in allied fields (e.g., microbiology, food science, and chemistry). It is also appropriate for students who anticipate a professional career in the health sciences. The honours specialization is the recommended route for students interested in graduate studies in biochemistry or related disciplines. However, students enrolled in a major specialization with a strong academic record may also apply for graduate studies. For more information, see [Biochemistry](http://www.biochem.ubc.ca).

### Co-operative (Co-op) Education Option

The department offers an optional Co-op Education Option (honours and majors). The program is open to interested and qualified students and is intended to provide additional practical and technical biochemical and molecular biological experience in academic and industrial research laboratories. This is normally achieved through a period of 12 to 15 months of approved work placement under the supervision of practising professionals. A faculty advisor will be assigned to each internship student. Acceptance into the Co-op Option is based upon academic standing and general suitability to perform in a technical research environment. The first phase is a placement for three or four months (summer following third year) in an academic research or industrial laboratory (either at UBC or at an off-campus site). This is normally followed by placement in off-site laboratories for three consecutive, four-month terms. Placements are arranged by mutual agreement of the student, employer, and faculty advisor through the Office of Co-operative Education. Students participating in the Co-op Option must register for off-site placements by using BIOC 398, 399, 498 and, where appropriate, 499, and pay the co-op education program fee for each course. After completion of the work terms, students return to the University for completion of the normal fourth-year major or honours academic requirements. This option requires five years and is not a requirement for admission to the graduate program in biochemistry and molecular biology.

Enrolment in the Co-op Education Option is limited; continuation in the option is contingent on the availability of suitable work placements. For more information contact the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).

13 All students in the Biochemistry Honours specializations are required to register for the laboratory course BIOC 301 in the third year of their specialization. Space is limited in this laboratory course. Students who cannot take BIOC 301 in their third year must switch to another specialization. They are not eligible to continue with a biochemistry specialization.

14 Alternatively, under exceptional circumstances and with the prior agreement of the Biochemistry Advisor, this requirement may be substituted with BIOC 421 and an additional 3 credits of biochemistry and molecular biology electives (see footnote 15).

 

15 At least 3 credits of biochemistry and molecular biology electives are required in the third or fourth year from the following list: BIOC 403, 440, 450, 460, or 470; 300- or 400-level chemistry courses; MICB 302, 306, 325, 403 or 405; PCTH 325; CAPS 301. Please note that BIOC 403, 440, 450, 460, or 470 cannot be double counted. If a student uses one of these courses to complete their specialization requirements, they cannot use the same course as a biochemistry and molecular biology elective.

2 Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100. CHEM 110 and CHEM 115 may substitute for CHEM 111. CHEM 120 and CHEM 115 may substitute for CHEM 121. CHEM 130 and CHEM 135 may substitute for CHEM 123.

 

3 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see [Communication Requirement](/node/15384).

4 While CPSC 110 is the recommended route for students pursuing a specialization in Computer Science, CPSC 103, 107 may be taken in its place using 2 credits of electives.

 

5 Students pursuing a Co-op program in Computer Science are advised to also take CPSC 210 in their first year or in the summer following their first year. Co-op students will then be in a position to take one or both of CPSC 221 and CPSC 213 in term one of second year before going out on a Co-op work term.

6 Students are permitted to move elective credits between years. Students who take courses in BIOL or MATH with more credits than those recommended may require fewer elective credits. Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s:  
a) [Foundational Requirement](/node/15386);  
b) [Laboratory Science Requirement](/node/15386#18467);  
c) [Science Breadth Requirement](/node/15398);  
d) [Science and Arts Requirements](/node/15385);  
e) [Upper-level Requirement](/node/15387);  
f) [General Degree Requirements](/node/15405).

7 It is recommended that students take at least 2 of BIOL 203, 204, 205, 209, 210. Students interested in phylogenetics should also take upper-level organismal courses and/or BIOL 417. MATH/STAT 302 and BIOL 436, BIOL 430, BIOL 440 and MICB 405 are recommended for those interested in bioinformatics or genomics. MATH 361 and 462 are recommended for those interested in modelling biological processes.

8 Suggested courses for those interested in bioinformatics are CPSC 304, 404, and 445.

9 Credits gained from undergraduate Student-Directed Seminars (BIOL 490, CPSC 490) can not be used to fulfill this requirement.

10 These 3 credits must be chosen from 400-level CPSC [lecture-based courses](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/computer-science).

 

11 If the credit total of these two laboratory courses exceeds 4, then the excess credits will count towards the requirement for 6 credits of BIOL courses numbered 300 or above.

 

Combined Honours: [Computer Science and Biology](/node/15412#23224) is also offered. Students must contact a computer science advisor for entry into the Combined Honours: Computer Science and Biology.

7 One of BIOL 230, BIOL 260, CHEM 235, CPSC 213, or MATH 200 can be deferred to third year.

8 CHEM 203 and 213 are also acceptable.

9 BIOL 447 is required for students intending to take BIOL 449.

 

10 Taken in fourth year; the thesis topic must be related to bioinformatics. Students intending to take CPSC 449 must take CPSC 349 in their third year.

11 We recommend that at least one of the remaining courses be taken as part of the 6 credits of CPSC courses numbered 300 or above.

12 Every student must complete at least 3 credits from [lecture based 400 level CPSC course(s)](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/computer-science).

 

13 Credits gained from undergraduate Student-Directed Seminars (CPSC 490) can not be used to fulfill this requirement.

 

14 It is possible to replace some of these credits by a life science course not on this list, as long as the replacement is approved by a Biology specialization advisor.

15 Bioinformatics or genomics electives can be upper-level BIOC, BIOL, CPSC, MATH, MICB, or STAT courses, excluding Student-Directed Seminars (BIOL 490, CPSC 490). Recommended courses include BIOL 338, 430, 436, 440. Students not taking CPSC 449 must have at least 3 credits of CPSC courses 400 or above, out of the 6 credits used to satisfy this requirement.
The [Department of Microbiology and Immunology](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca) at UBC and the Biotechnology Program at the BC Institute of Technology (BCIT) offer a five-year joint degree Co-operative Education Program that integrates academic study at both institutions with related and supervised work experience. Enrolment is limited. Entry into the specialization is at the second-year level and requires completion of the first-year prerequisites listed below with at least the minimum admission average set by the UBC Faculty of Science for transfer into second year Honours specializations.

Student must apply for the specialization. See [BCIT Biotechnology](http://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/8910bsc) for details.

The first year of the specialization can be taken at UBC or another institution. The second and third years (taken at the BCIT campus) include two four-month work terms along with academic and technical studies. The fourth and fifth years (taken at the UBC campus) include two four-month work terms and advanced studies. Students must meet the Faculty of Science requirement to continue in this Honours specialization (see [Honours Specialization](/node/15401) requirements). Completion of the requirements for the first three years of the specialization earns a Diploma of Technology in Biotechnology.

Completion of the requirements for the entire five-year specialization earns an Honours Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology. The credentials are awarded jointly by UBC and BCIT. Students who fail to maintain the Faculty of Science requirements for continuing in honours specializations in their fourth or fifth year need to request transfer credit for their BCIT courses if they intend to enrol in the other specializations such as the Microbiology and Immunology Major.

1 Students without Biology 11 or 12 must take BIOL 111. Applicants from other universities and colleges may substitute 6 credits of introductory biology courses for two of BIOL 111, 112, 121.

2 Applicants from other universities and colleges may substitute 3 credits of introductory chemistry that includes a lab. Students who do not have BC high school Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100. CHEM 110 and CHEM 115 may substitute for CHEM 111. CHEM 120 and CHEM 115 may substitute for CHEM 121. CHEM 130 and CHEM 135 may substitute for CHEM 123.

3 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see [Communication Requirement](/node/15384)

4 Students must take one differential calculus course during first year of studies at UBC. MATH 180 or 184 or 120 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 1 credit. MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 3 credits.

5 Students require 3 credits of 100-level PHYS beyond PHYS 100. Students lacking Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 in first year. Another 3 credits of PHYS may be taken at any time during the specialization but PHYS 100 must be taken during first year.

6 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s:  
a) [Foundational Requirement](/node/15386);  
b) [Laboratory Science Requirement](/node/15386#18467);  
c) [Science Breadth Requirement](/node/15398);  
d) [Science and Arts Requirements](/node/15385);  
e) [Upper-level Requirement](/node/15387);  
f) [General Degree Requirements](/node/15405).  
Note that BCIT credits include 9 UBC Arts credits and 3 credits equivalent to UBC STAT 200.

7 Students should be aware that BIOL 140 is a prerequisite for many upper-level BIOL courses at UBC. To maintain flexibility in their ability to study at UBC, students should consider including BIOL 140 in their first year at UBC even though this course is not required in the Biotechnology specialization.

 

8 The credit for the work terms is not included in the academic credits needed for the degree or the totals for the academic year. Students must take at least one work term as either a Fall work term or a Winter work term. The remaining work term may be done as a Fall, Winter, or Summer work term. The Biotechnology specialization normally ends with a final study term.

 

9 Some courses only fit particular timetables. Plan schedules to have a minimum of 15 credits in each academic term in the winter session of year four. Students graduating in May at the end of year 5 only need to take enough academic credit to fulfill the requirements of the specialization.

 

10 If more than one of these courses are taken, the extra courses can count as part of the 6 credits of courses from the Biotechnology selection list.

 

11 MICB 448 would normally be 3 credits. It may be taken as 6 credits if the total number of electives in fourth and fifth years is lowered from 9 credits to 6 credits, so the total required credit remains at 42 credits.

 

### Co-operative Education Program: Biotechnology in Microbiology and Immunology

See the [Microbiology and Immunology](/node/15422#10540) program.
The [Department of Botany](http://www.botany.ubc.ca) offers programs of study jointly with the Department of Zoology leading to the Bachelor of Science in Biology.

The Department of Botany offers programs leading to the master's and doctoral degrees in a wide range of contemporary plant studies, including phytogeography, ecology (including ecophysiology), ethnobotany, systematics (including chemotaxonomy), morphology and plant development, cytology, membrane biochemistry and physiology, chemical ecology, and molecular genetics. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Botany](/node/15016) and the Department of Botany's Graduate Brochure, available in the Botany Office.
The [Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences](http://www.physiology.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Cell and Developmental Biology](/node/15124). For further information on other courses within the Department, see the [Faculty of Medicine](/node/15219).

Completion of first year specialization requirements and the second year organic chemistry requirement are prerequisites to all CAPS courses.

### Admission to the Honours Cellular, Anatomical and Physiological Sciences B.Sc. Specialization

Students may apply to enter the specialization at the end of first year through the common application which is administered by the [Office of the Dean of Science](http://science.ubc.ca/students/degree/secondyear). If admitted for second year, students must follow the program of study and meet the academic standards below.

Students must apply in person to the Department for admission into the specialization no later than March 31 prior to the third year in their B.Sc. program. Application forms are available on the [Cellular and Physiological Sciences website](http://www.cellphys.ubc.ca).The academic standards for Year 2 CAPS students to continue to Year 3 are:(1) complete all required first and second year courses;(2) achieve a cumulative 80% average;(3) a minimum grade of 80% in the required biology and chemistry courses;(4) a minimum of 70% in Communications courses; and,(5) complete at least 33 credits in winter session of second year.

Other students who have met these requirements may also apply for entry in third year.

Students should note that required courses must be taken in the year in which they appear in the program (e.g., BIOC 301 and 302 will be taken in the third year of a student's program, MICB 202 in the second year, etc.).

Permission of the Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences is required to alter the progression throughout the specialization.

Students wishing to undertake directed studies at the undergraduate (CAPS 448) level must seek departmental apdents

Second-year course registration in Chemistry specializations uses Standard Timetables (STT). The comments in the Course Schedule associated with an STT provide useful information that students should consult before contacting an Undergraduate Advisor. Students are required to have completed the equivalent of two one-semester introductory chemistry courses. Students intending to take organic chemistry (CHEM 203/213 or CHEM 233) should be familiar with the organic chemistry content found in [CHEM 123](http://www.chem.ubc.ca/courses).

#### Comments for Third-Year Students

It is recommended that students taking BIOL 201 should have completed a university-level biology course with cell biology content (e.g., BIOL 200). Major and Combined Major students normally complete the appropriate laboratory courses (CHEM 315/325/335/345) in third year to have prerequisites for the fourth-year laboratory course CHEM 445. Honours students should complete CHEM 319/329 and CHEM 345 in third year as preparation for the fourth-year research course, CHEM 449.

#### Comments for Fourth-Year Students

It is recommended that students taking BIOL 201 should have completed a university-level biology course with cell biology content (e.g., BIOL 200).

With permission from the Undergraduate Advisor, Major or Combined Major students may substitute CHEM 445 and 3 credits of 400-level CHEM lecture electives with CHEM 449. Honours students are required to take CHEM 449.

#### Laboratory and Tutorial Courses

Students taking any course which has an associated laboratory and/or tutorial must register in these secondary activities in addition to the lecture portion of the course. No exception will be made. Students who believe they may qualify for an exemption from a laboratory (e.g., if repeating the course, or have transfer credit from another institution) are advised to contact the appropriate laboratory instructor directly. Students who miss the first laboratory meeting of a course without having made prior arrangements with the instructor concerned risk having their registration in the course cancelled and their space reallocated to another student.

#### Specific Focus Areas

Major and honours students may wish to direct their elective credits towards a specific focus area in chemistry. The Department has generated recommendations for course selections designed to build strength in a [Specific Focus Area](http://www.chem.ubc.ca/focus-areas). Students are encouraged to use these recommendations as a guide.

1 Of the 6 credits required to satisfy the Communication Requirement, 3 credits are specified in third year (CHEM 300). The remaining 3 credits must be chosen from the list of acceptable courses, see [Commis intended to help prepare interested and qualified students for careers in the computing industry with a minimum of 4 work placements supervised by practising professionals. Co-op advisors also visit students at their place of work and provide advice on technical reports required of all students in the Co-op Option.

To be eligible, students must be admitted to the second year of a Computer Science specialization in the Bachelor of Science program. Selection of students will be based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as determined by resumé and interview. The total enrolment will be subject to the availability of appropriate work placements and faculty advisors. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between students and employing organizations. Participating students register for CPSC 298, 299, 398, 399, or 499 as appropriate, and pay the Co-operative Education Option fee for each course (see [Program and Course Fees](/fees/program-course-and-faculty-fees)). Graduation in the Option requires a student to complete at least four of CPSC 298, 299, 398, 399 and 499, in addition to the normal academic requirements. Students who complete less than five courses will have each satisfactorily completed course noted on their academic record.

Detailed information on the Option may be obtained from the Department of Computer Science or from the [Co-operative Education Option](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).

### Admission and Continuation Requirements for Honours and Combined Honours

Students who wish to register in an Honours or Combined Honours specialization in Computer Science, must seek approval from the Department Honours advisor prior to registering for second year.

To be admitted to an Honours or Combined Honours specialization in Computer Science, students must:

1.  complete all courses attempted, including at least 30 credits in the Winter Session of the first year; and
2.  obtain a minimum average of 76%. Achievement of this minimum does not guarantee admission.

To be permitted to continue in an Honours or Combined Honours specialization in Computer Science, students must:

1.  complete all courses attempted, including at least 30 credits in the previous Winter Session (or at least 15 credits per academic term, for Co-op students); and
2.  obtain an average of 72% or higher.

### Lecture-based courses

In the description of the Computer Science specialization requirements, the words “lecture-based” courses refer to all CPSC courses except for CPSC 436I, 448, 449, 455 and 491.

### Electives

COMM 337 has overlap with some of the first or second-year Computer Science courses and cannot be used as electives in any degree or combined degree specialization in Computer Science.

#### Specialization Objectives

Mastery of the curriculum will:

1.  qualify students for employment in various areas within the earth sciences, including allowing students with the appropriate course background to register as a Professional Geoscientist (P.Geo.) with Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia (EGBC);
2.  allow students to apply for graduate school in an earth science discipline (depending on course background).

#### Learning Goals

Students completing this specialization will be able to:

1.  demonstrate basic knowledge of either atmospheric sciences, geological sciences, geophysics, or oceanography, or a broad range of earth sciences that covers several of these disciplines;
2.  integrate concepts across the earth science disciplines;
3.  demonstrate an understanding of the varying time and spatial scales over which Earth processes occur;
4.  manipulate data in the context of the earth sciences;
5.  write reports and communicate various concepts and ideas in earth science.
The B.Sc. specialization in Environmental Sciences, offered by the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, is designed to give students a broad perspective on the environment. The specialization concentrates on understanding the major environmental issues facing human societies and it adopts an integrative cross-disciplinary approach to the study of these issues. The specialization provides a significant background in earth, ocean, atmospheric, and life sciences, and chemistry. The core courses, ENVR 200, 300, 400, and 449, examine environmental issues through seminars and student projects. Students are required to select an Area of Concentration that includes required and elective courses.

Students wishing to enter second-year Environmental Sciences Major or Honours specializations must apply using the [online process](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply) administered by the Faculty of Science. Students will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or June. Due to the similarity between the Major and Honours Environmental Science specializations in second year, the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to the Majors. For Honours, students require a minimum 72% average in prior courses for admission, and must maintain at least a 68% average for continuation in the program. Qualified students wishing to transfer to Honours should contact the Undergraduate Advisor for advice. The progress of continuing environmental science students will be reviewed at the end of each academic year. Students making satisfactory progress do not require annual specialization approval. The advisor will contact students with unsatisfactory standing in Honours.

A five-year Co-operative Education option is available in Environmental Sciences. The option is intended to help prepare interested and qualified students for careers in environmental sciences and related fields. This is achieved through a minimum of 14 months of approved work placement under the supervision of practising professionals. To be eligible, students must be admissible into third year of the B.Sc. Major in Environmental Sciences. Admission is by application to the Co-op Office in term 2 of the second year. Selection of students will be based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as determined by resume and interview. Total enrolment in the option is subject to the availability of work placements. Work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between employers and students. Participating students must register for EOSC 398, 399, 498, and 499 as appropriate, and pay the required Co-operative Education fee per course (see Program and Course Fees). Graduation in the Co-operative Education option requires a student to complete each of EOSC 398, 399, 498, and 499, in addition to the normal requirements.

For additional information, see [Environmental Sciences](https://science.ubc.ca/students/programs/environmental-sciences). Please contact Environmental Sciences at 604.822.2449 with any questions.

### Minor (3085): Environmental Sciences (ENSC)

The Minor consists of 21 credits: ENVR 200, ENVR 300; 6 credits from: EOSC 372, BIOL 306, GEOS (or GEOB) 305; and 9 credits from: ENVR 400, 410, 420, 430, 440
The [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://biochem.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia and the [Forensics Science and Technology department](http://www.bcit.ca/cas/forensics) at the BC Institute of Technology (BCIT) offer a four-year joint degree program that integrates academic study at both institutions. Enrolment is limited. Entry into the specialization is at the second-year level and requires completion of the first-year prerequisites listed below with at least the minimum admission average set by the UBC Faculty of Science for transfer into second year Honours specializations.

Students normally apply for this specialization through the [UBC science online second year specialization selection process](http://science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply). Students transferring from other specializations, year levels, or other institutions should see a UBC biochemistry advisor. Applicants should also be aware that most careers in Forensic Science require criminal background checks.

The first year of the specialization is completed at UBC. Transfer students who have completed their first year at another institution may also apply to the program. All subsequent years will be taken at both UBC and BCIT, requiring students to commute between the two campuses (scheduling will reflect travel time). Students must meet the Faculty of Science requirement to continue in this Honours specialization (see [Honours Specialization](/node/15401) requirements). Students will need to maintain a winter sessional average of 70% or higher to remain in the specialization.

Completion of the requirements for the entire four- year specialization earns a Bachelor of Science (Combined Honours) in Biochemistry and Forensic Science. The credential is awarded jointly by UBC and BCIT. Students who fail to maintain the Faculty of Science requirements for continuing in honours specializations, or who elect not to complete the joint program, but who wish to enrol in a different specialization within the Faculty of Science must apply to receive transfer credit for completed BCIT credits to have the BCIT credits counted towards a new specialization.

### Co-operative (Co-op) Education Option

The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology department offers an optional Co-op Education Option for the Biochemistry and Forensic Science Honours Program. The program is open to interested and qualified students and is intended to provide additional practical and technical biochemical and molecular biological, and forensic science experience in academic, public, and industrial research laboratories or law enforcement agencies. This is normally achieved through a period of 12 to 15 months of approved work placement under the supervision of practising professionals. Acceptance into the Co-op Option is based upon academic standing and general suitability to perform in a technical research environment.

In order to graduate with the Co-op option students must complete a minimum of three work terms (a work term being a minimum of 14 weeks) in an academic research, public, or industrial laboratory or law enforcement agency (either at UBC or at an off-campus site). Placements are arranged by mutual agreement of the student, employer, and faculty advisor through the Office of Co-operative Education. Students participating in the Co-op Option must register for off-site placements by using FSCT 398, 399, 498 and, where appropriate, 499, and pay the co-op education program fee for each course. After completion of the work terms, students return to the University for completion of the normal fourth-year academic requirements.

This option requires five years and is not a requirement for admission to the graduate program in biochemistry and molecular biology. Enrolment in the Co-op Education Option is limited; continuation in the option is contingent on the availability of suitable work placements. For more information contact the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/).

2 Honours students must comply with the [Faculty of Science's honours requirements](/node/15401).
The [Department of Microbiology and Immunology](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Microbiology and Immunology](/node/15075).

The Department offers versatile major and honours specializations leading to the Bachelor of Science. All students take the same core courses but appropriate choices of selections allow students to develop foundations in diverse areas such as applied microbiology, environmental microbiology, immunology, microbial pathogenesis, microbial physiology, molecular genetics, virology, bioinformatics, computer science and oceanography. Eligible students entering second year wanting to apply to the Joint Degree Biotechnology Honours specialization and all students wanting to enter second year Microbiology and Immunology Major, Honours or second year Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology Major, Honours or Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations must apply using the online process administered by the Faculty of Science. Eligible students finishing first year will receive an email communication regarding the process in late May or early June. Due to the similarity between the Major and Honours specializations in second year the Faculty of Science only admits students directly to the Major or the Combined Major.

MICB 322 (Molecular Microbiology Laboratory) is a required course for the Microbiology and Immunology Major and Honour, and Combined Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations. It is an elective course for students in the Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology Major and Honour specializations.

The Department offers MICB 322 in term 1 of the Winter session and term 1 of the Summer session. All students entering third-year in good standing in the Microbiology and Immunology Major and Combined Microbiology and Oceanography Major specializations will be placed into MICB 322. Students are required to apply to the Department for placement in the Winter or Summer sessions of MICB 322. Students are given priority based on their academic performance. See [here](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/undergraduate/application-admission) for details.

Students interested in transferring into the Microbiology & Immunology specializations after year 2 can apply to the Department for a seat in MICB 322. Acceptance is contingent on space availability. See [here](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/undergraduate/application-admission) for details.

The applications will open in mid-April. See [here](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/undergraduate/application-admission/application-forms) for more information.

Qualified students may apply to transfer to an Honours specialization in third year. Enrolment in any Microbiology and Immunology Honours specialization or combined Honours specialization, requires a sustained, annual academic average of at least 75% in second, third, and fourth year of these specializations.

### Co-operative Education Option

This option integrates academic study with relevant supervised work experience. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between the students and the employing organizations. Enrolment is limited. Admission is by application to the Science Co-op Office in February prior to third year (late applicants may be considered if they contact the Life Sciences Co-op Coordinator). Selection will be based on previous academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as assessed by resumé and interview. Admissibility to a third-year Microbiology and Immunology Bachelor of Science specialization is prerequisite for admission to the Co-op Option but applicants can apply to Co-op before admission to the third-year microbiology specializations. Graduation from the Co-op program requires completion of four work terms, the normal courses required for the specialization. Detailed information is available from [Microbiology and Immunology](http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca) or the [Co-operative Education Office](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/home/contact).

### B.Sc. Major in Cognitive Systems

The Cognitive Systems (COGS) Major (B.Sc. or B.A.) integrates aspects of psychology, linguistics, computer science and philosophy relevant to examining cognition in human and machine systems. The COGS B.Sc. Major in Brain and Cognition, supervised by the Department of Psychology, emphasizes this interdisciplinary endeavour from the perspective of cognitive- and neuro-psychology.

All COGS-designated core courses (COGS 200, 300, 303, 401, and 402) have an emphasis on the collaborative engagement of students in curricular and research projects. The specialization aims for its graduates to possess the background competence necessary to enter graduate research programs in one of the contributing disciplines, or in cognitive science itself.

For information about admission to the COGS (B.Sc.) major streams, see [Computer Science](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/computer-science#14865) and [Neuroscience](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/neuroscience). For information about admission to the COGS (B.A.) major streams, see [Linguistics](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-arts/bachelor-arts/linguistics#9020), [Philosophy](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-arts/bachelor-arts/philosophy#19110), and [Psychology](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-arts/bachelor-arts/psychology#9034).

The minor consists of 18 credits, including all of EOSC 340, 372, 373, and three of EOSC 470 - 489 including at least two of EOSC 470, 471 and 472. See [Minor in Science](/node/15407#4953).
The [Department of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics](http://www.pharmacology.ubc.ca) offers opportunities for study leading to doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees. For information on advanced degrees, see graduate [Pharmacology](/node/15085). For further information on other courses within the department, see the [Faculty of Medicine](/node/15219). All students who intend to take the B.Sc. in Pharmacology must consult the undergraduate advisor.

Enrolment in PCTH 300 is restricted to students in the third year of the various Pharmacology specializations. Students who wish to enter Pharmacology specializations need to have completed all prerequisites and obtained an average of greater than 75% in each of their first and second years.

The aim of the programs is to produce a graduate broadly trained in all aspects of pharmacology. The programs emphasize the experimental and laboratory aspects of pharmacology and students learn both whole animal and isolated tissue techniques, as well as biochemical and chemical procedures. Skills that are stressed include the ability to search for information, design appropriate experiments, carry out experiments individually and as a member of a team, analyze data, and communicate and write effectively.

### Co-operative Education Program

The Department offers a five-year Co-operative Education option (honours and major). In addition to classical laboratory-based university instruction, the student will receive 12 to 16 months of work placement (i.e., three to four work terms) in at least two different research areas supervised by scientists in a pharmaceutical company or equivalent. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement among students, faculty, and employing organizations. Faculty advisors will visit students at their place of work and provide advice on technical reports. Work placement starts in May or September after the completion of third year and continues through fourth year.

Students in the Honours specialization will take additional credits in second, third, and fourth years and will conduct a laboratory-based research project for six months (September to March) during fifth year supervised by a faculty member within or outside the Department and present an Honours thesis (PCTH 449). Students participating in the Co-op oested and qualified students for research careers in industry with at least four work placements (each placement is normally 16 weeks long) supervised by practising professionals. Faculty advisors or Co-op coordinators also visit students at their place of work and provide advice on technical reports required of all students in the program.

To be eligible, students must be admissible into the second-year Physics or Astronomy Bachelor of Science program with an average above 68%. Admission is by application to the Co-op Office. Selection of students will be based on academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as determined by their resume and interview. Enrolment is subject to the availability of appropriate work placements and faculty advisors. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between the students and the employing organizations. Participating students will register for PHYS 298, 299, 399, 498, or 499 as appropriate, and pay the co-operative education program fee per course and Co-op workshop fees (see [Co-operative Education Program Fees](/fees/program-course-and-faculty-fees)).

Graduation in the program requires a student to complete at least four of PHYS 298, 299, 399, 498 and 499, in addition to the normal academic requirements. Not all of the work terms may be in summer. Students will have each satisfactorily completed course noted on their academic record.

Detailed information on the program may be obtained from the Department of Physics or the [Co-operative Education Program](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca).

13 The specialization requires at least 9 credits of upper-level PHYS or ASTR courses including at least 6 credits at the 400-level or higher. Suggested upper-level electives are ASTR 403, 404, 406; MATH 301, 345, 401, 402, 405, 418, 420, 450; PHYS 400, 405, 407, 410, 437, 447, 473, 474. Qualified students are encouraged to take 500-level physics courses for which they must have permission of the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

14 With permission of an undergraduate physics and astronomy advisor, another course may replace MATH 400.

1 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communications Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see [Communication Requirement](/node/15384).

2 Students who do not have B.C. High School Physics 12 (or its equivalent) must take PHYS 100 prior to other PHYS courses. Students that took PHYS 101 or 131 may enter the specialization but will need to take PHYS 106, 107, 117, or 170 before the required PHYS 216.

3 Students who do not have BC High School Biology 11 or Biology 12 or equivalent must take BIOL 111 before taking BIOL 112 or BIOL 180. Students who do not have BC High School Chemistry 12 or equivalent must take CHEM 100 or CHEM 111 before taking BIOL 112. 4 Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100. CHEM 110 and 115 may substitute for CHEM 111. CHEM 120 and CHEM 115 may substitute for CHEM 121. CHEM 130 and 135 may substitute for CHEM 123.

 

4 Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100.

5 Some course alternates have different credit value. The number of electives in each year is chosen to balance the total number of credits (i.e., make the yearly total close to 33). However, since the number of available elective credits may not be a multiple of three, students are permitted to move elective credits between years.

6 BIOL 180 is recommended, however Biology has agreed to waive BIOL 180 as a course prerequisite for students in Combined Honours Biophysics. Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s:  
a) [Foundational Requirement](/node/15386);  
b) [Laboratory Science Requirement](/node/15386#18467);  
c) [Science Breadth Requirement](/node/15398);

d) [Science and Arts Requirements](/node/15385);

  
e) [Upper-level Requirement](/node/15387);  
f) [General Degree Requirements](/node/15405).  
Honours specializations have additional requirements, see [Introduction to Degree Options](/node/15401).

7 For admission to the specialization, students must be in good standing with an overall standing of at least 68% in each first-year physics and mathematics course. See also [Introduction to Degree Options](/node/15401), [Second Year Application](http://science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply), [Promotion to Second Year](/node/15388#18476), and [Admission as a Post-Secondary Transfer](/node/15403#1630).

8 MATH 200 plus MATH 317 can replace MATH 217 by using 2 elective credits.

9 Consultation with a Physics Department advisor is recommended before entering third- and fourth-year. See also [Introduction to Degree Options](/node/15401), [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388#18480) and [Courses Required for Promotion](/node/15392).

 

10 See Bio-Science Electives below. Note that 3 credits of bio-science electives may be used to replace BIOC 302 (3) with BIOC 303 (6). Students considering the co-op option are highly recommended to take BIOC 301 as one of the Bio-Science Electives in their third year.

11 It is possible for students to replace PHYS 449 with BIOC 449, BIOL 449, or MICB 449 with approval from both the Biophysics Advisor and the other department.

### Bio-Science Electives

The 18 credits of bio-sciences in the third and fourth years must include at least one laboratory course from the following recommended list or approved by the Biophysics advisor: BIOC 301, BIOL 337, BIOL 340, BIOL 341, BIOL 351, BIOL 352, BIOL 363, BIOL 437, MICB 322, MICB 323. The electives should concentrate mainly on one of the following bsystem as long as the required coursework and exams have been completed prior to attendance in a degree program at UBC. Such students are advised to consult departmental advisors at UBC before registering in any second-year courses. Prospective UBC students who have completed or are registered in a secondary school calculus course should see the [Calculus Examination Certificate](/node/15562#24065).

Advance credit will count toward a degree program unless an equivalent course is taken at UBC, but does not count as part of the credit load in the first year at UBC. A student who is eligible for advance credit but who chooses to take an equivalent UBC course and does not pass it may not use the advance credit toward a degree.

For detailed information about advance credit for courses taken in the International Baccalaureate, Advanced Placement, or A-level programs, consult [youbc Vancouver](http://you.ubc.ca).

### Transfer Credit

UBC will grant credit for academic study at recognized post-secondary institutions. In general, transfer credit is limited to courses at the 100- and 200-levels to a maximum of 50% of the minimum credit requirements for the primary specialization pursued in the B.Sc. program.

Credit at a more senior level is possible if prior written permission has been obtained from the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising). Under no circumstances will a student be granted transfer credit for more than 12 credits of upper-level coursework. Although pre-approved upper-level transfer credit may be included in the required credits numbered 300 or above, a B.Sc. program must include a minimum of 30 credits of upper-level UBC Vancouver Science courses required by the specialization.

The limits noted above apply equally to students admitted from UBC Okanagan, although for them, courses attempted at both campuses appear on one transcript, so the term "transfer credit" is not applied.

A student who is eligible for transfer credit but who chooses to take an equivalent UBC course and does not pass it may not use the transfer credit toward a degree.

Because similar courses at different UBC campuses often bear different course numbers and credits, a student who transfers from another UBC campus is advised to consult the [Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) regarding applicability of credits to the UBC Vancouver B.Sc.

The Admission Office provides students with general information about the UBC Vancouver equivalents of courses taken elsewhere. Not all credits will apply towards specific degree requirements.

Questions about the applicability of transfer credits should be directed to an academic advisor in your preferred area of study, who will then communicate with the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) who will confirm the final decision.

Of the courses taken as part of the International Program at the UBC Vantage College, credit for Science and Arts courses and for VANT 148 and 149 will apply to a program in the Faculty of Science. VANT 140 and LLED courses will not apply.

Students transferring to the Faculty from other programs at UBC must consult the [Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) regarding applicability to the B.Sc. of credits earned prior to entering the Faculty.

### Summer Session Credit

Summer Session credit will count toward a degree program, but Summer Session courses do not count as part of the full-time program in a Winter Session. The maximum credit for any Summer Session is 14 credits, except with the permission of the Assistant Dean Students of [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising). It is not possible to take two laboratory science courses concurrently in Summer Session. Summer Session is assessed independently of Winter Session (see [Continuation Requirements](/node/15380#18554)).

Students accepted into the Summer program at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (BMSC) may take up to 18 credits of MRNE courses in a single Summer Session. Students accepted to the BMSC Summer program may contact the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) to have their credit limit adjusted.

### Studies at Other Secondary or Post-Secondary Institutions: Letter of Permission

Students newly admitted to the B.Sc. are not permitted to continue taking courses at their previous institution(s) at the same time as they take UBC courses.

Once accepted to the Faculty of Science, students are expected to complete all further credits required for the program with courses offered by the Vancouver campus or through exchange at a Go Global partner.

A Letter of Permission may, in special circumstances, be issued authorizing a student to study at another post-secondary institution with the intention of later transferring credits earned to the UBC transcript. The Faculty has no obligation to grant transfer credit unless a prior Letter of Permission has been obtained. To be issued a Letter of Permission, the student must:

*   be in Good Standing
*   have eligibility to continue in the program
*   have personal circumstances that necessitate study elsewhere
*   not be registered at UBC in the same term

For the duration of the degree program, study on a Letter of Permission is limited to six credits. A student with unusual personal circumstances that necessitate an absence from campus and who wishes to take more credits elsewhere should present the case to an Advisor in the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising).

Permission will be considered only for first- or second-year courses but not for courses that fulfill the [Communication Requirement](/node/15384), or [Lower-level Requirements](/node/15386), or [Science Breadth Requirement](/node/15398) or are required for a specialization. Permission will not be considered for secondary school courses.

A student who is granted a Letter of Permission is responsible for ensuring that the other institution sends an official transcript directly to Undergraduate Admissions in Enrolment Services. The student must also submit to Enrolment Services an [Added Credit for Letter of Permission form](http://students.ubc.ca/sites/students.ubc.ca/files/AddedCreditforLetterofPermissionForm_2013.pdf).

The application for a Letter of Permission is available on the Science students’ [website](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising/LOP).

Permission to study at one of UBC's Go Global exchange partner institutions is obtained through a separate application process (see [Go Global Student Exchange](/node/15699)), not via a Letter of Permission.
Students should also refer to the University's detailed [registration information](http://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/courses/registration) and other guidance at [Current Students](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students).

Students are encouraged to register on their assigned date of registration. Enrolment in the Faculty is limited and admission to the Faculty does not guarantee that space will be available in any specific program, course, or section. Where the limitation of enrolment becomes necessary, the criteria for implementation normally are academic standing in the preceding Winter Session and grades in prerequisite courses. Students are encouraged to consult individual department or program offices for details of any restrictions on enrolment.

Students may not attend courses for which they have not registered or attend sections of courses other than those in which they are registered.

It is the responsibility of students to determine that they are registered and have selected courses for which they have the prerequisite. Students who are registered on wait-lists are expected to check online to determine whether they have been placed in the course by the department; such changes in registration may occur after classes start. Students may not register themselves in conflicting course activities. Any conflicts created by course administrators must be resolved by dropping one of the courses. If uncertainties arise, students should consult the administrative office of the department that offers the course.

Prerequisites are courses that must be successfully completed before taking a course. Prerequisites can be fulfilled with equivalent courses or exempted with the permission of the instructor.

Credit excluded courses are courses that have sufficient overlap in content that credit will be given for only one course or combination of courses listed in the [Credit Exclusion Lists](/node/15408). Credit excluded courses are not equivalent, so permission of a program advisor is required for substitution of a required course with a course from the Credit Exclusion Lists.

Corequisites are courses that must either be taken concurrently with another course or be successfully completed before taking the other course.

Recommended courses provide background that would be helpful for the student when taking a course, but are not required.

Students registered in any science course that has a laboratory must attend their first scheduled laboratory class in that course. Failure to do so may result in termination of the student's registration in the course. Students who are unable to attend their first scheduled laboratory class in a course must notify the administrative office of the department concerned within 48 hours of the time affixed for that class or have their registration in the course terminated.

In general, students who pass a course can use it as a prerequisite for a subsequent course in that subject. However, departments do have the right to bar entrance to their programs and to third-year courses by students who obtain only a minimum passing grade in their first- or second-year prerequisite course or courses.

After two weeks of lectures, students (full-time or part-time) are not permitted to change the program for which they are registered except in special circumstances and with the permission of the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising).

Within time limits students may [drop or withdraw](/node/15650) from courses using the [Student Service Centre](http://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/sscportal/servlets/SRVSSCFramework). After these dates, students are not normally permitted to withdraw from courses but may apply for Academic Concession (see Calendar Chapter V).
Students registered in the B.Sc. program may not at the same time be registered in courses at another secondary or post-secondary institution without prior approval. See [Concurrent Studies at UBC and Another Post-secondary Institution](/node/15377#18642).

A student who has passed a course will not be permitted to repeat that course for higher standing. Courses in the [Science Credit Exclusion Lists](/node/15408) are considered to be the same course for the purposes of this rule. A student who, because of a change of specialization, is required to attempt a course that shares credit exclusion with a course already passed should consult academic advisors in the appropriate department and also in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising).

A student may repeat a failed course only once without special permission. A student can take a course a third time, but will need permission from the Assistant Dean Students in Science Advising \[Link to: [https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising)\] to do so. Courses required to satisfy the Faculty of Science Communication requirement or MATH 100 (or equivalent) may be repeated twice without special permission. A student can take these courses a fourth time, but will need permission from the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising). to do so. Courses in the Science Credit Exclusion Lists are considered to be the same course for the purposes of this rule. Appeals for further attempts must be directed to the Assistant Dean Students in Science Advising \[Link to: [https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising)\]. A student repeating a course more than once will be required to limit the credits attempted in that term.

### First-Year Students

First-year students do not choose a specialization and are not required to obtain Faculty approval before registering. The Science One Program and the First-Year Focus (FYF) Program described in [First-Year Options](/node/15406) are first-year course packages, not specializations.

Students entering first year and wishing to enrol in Science One must submit a formal application for admission to this course of study by April 30. Admitted first-year students wishing to enrol in the First-Year Focus Program register directly through the Student Service Centre. See [First-year Options](/node/15406).

Students should plan their first year knowing both the general [Lower-level Requirements](/node/15386) (must be completed before a student is promoted to fourth-year) and the specific courses required for the specialization they plan to enter in second year. Guidance is provided through [New Students](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/new). Students should consult the information on [Credit](/node/15377) as well as with [New Students](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/new) if their first-year program is non-standard because of advanced placement or transfer credit.

Students who are considering transferring out of the Faculty of Science after first year should contact the other faculty directly and consult with a program advisor to plan elective choices that will facilitate this transition.

Advanced credit from enriched high school programs does not count as part of the credit load in the first year at UBC but may count toward degree requirements as long as equivalent UBC courses are not taken.

### Students Entering Second Year

Students entering second year by way of promotion or transfer must be admitted to a major, combined major, honours, combined honours, or General Science specialization before being able to register in courses. For such students admission to all specializations is coordinated through a central online application process. Students will receive an email regarding this process in late May or early June, but are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the application process and specialization prerequisites well in advance during first year (see [SecondYear Application](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/apply)).

Many honours and combined honours options are not available to students moving into second year; interested students should apply for the corresponding major and then consult the specialization advisor while in second year. Honours and combined honours options require students to complete a Winter Session load of at least 30 credits. Students who complete slightly fewer credits in first year may be considered for admission upon completion of second year if they have made up the credit deficit during their second Winter Session and have met other requirements. An appeal can be directed to the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://science.ubc.ca/students/advising) with support from the honours advisor in the area of specialization.

### Continuing Second, Third, and Fourth-Year Students

Normally students continuing in second year are not permitted to change their specialization until the end of the Winter Session.

Students entering into or continuing in third or fourth year who wish to change their specialization must seek approval from a specialization advisor for the new specialization they wish to declare. (Students are not permitted to change their specialization directly on the Student Service Centre.) Some specializations have limited enrolment and are unable to accept all students who meet minimum qualifications. In such cases, students must apply for admission through specialization-specific admission processes. Consult specialization web pages for more information and application deadlines (see [Degree Planning](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree)). See also the information on [honours and combined honours](/node/15401) above. Changing specializations may result in lengthening of the time to complete the B.Sc. Students transferring into third year from another faculty or institution must seek admission to a specialization through the same processes prior to registering for courses.

Students not meeting the academic standing required for compulsory courses in a given specialization may be required to withdraw and gain entry into another. Specifically, students are required to satisfy a minimum academic achievement average on three-fifths (3/5) of the credits listed in the second year of a student's declared specialization (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)), not including electives or courses taken to satisfy the [Communication Requirement](/node/15384). For a student in General Science or the Combined Major in Science, the courses on which the average is calculated are chosen from the ones required for promotion to third year (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)). At the discretion of the specialization advisor, students who do not meet the minimum average may be removed from that specialization and required to gain admission to another.

Students intending to do a double major in Science or in Science and Arts, or a Dual Degree in Science and Arts must gain admission to a science major upon entry into their second year and then obtain approval for the other major before the start of their third year. A form is available from [Majors, Honours, and Minors](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/types). The form requires approval of advisors in both major areas and of the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising). Interested students are encouraged to plan first- and second-year courses so as to meet the prerequisite requirements for the desired major areas concurrently (see program listings in [Bachelor of Arts](/node/14616) and the Bachelor of Science).

Additional requirements apply to the Dual Degree in Science and Music and the Dual Degree in Science and Education (see Degree Requirements in this chapter).

Students who are pursuing a single major, a combined major, an honours, or a combined honours option may be approved to also pursue a Minor in Science, Arts, Kinesiology or Land and Food Systems; they must obtain approval before the start of their third year. A form is available from [Majors, Honours, and Minors](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/types). Students intending to do a minor in Commerce must apply in second term of their second year (see Minor in Commerce).

Students may pursue at most two specializations, e.g., two majors, a major and one minor, or a dual degree, in order to ensure that course space can be available to more students and to ensure that each admitted student has the possibility of completing degree requirements in a reasonable time.

Unless students are registered in a specific specialization their academic records cannot be adjudicated for graduation.
The Faculty of Science offers the following options for enrolment in first year:

1.  The standard program, in which students admitted to the Faculty design their own program according to [Degree Requirements](/node/15405), selecting both the courses and the sections they wish to attend.
2.  The Science One Program (28 credits) is a unique program that emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of science in a small class environment with a standard timetable. A separate application is [required](http://scienceone.ubc.ca/).
3.  The First-Year Focus (FYF) option, in which students admitted to the Faculty attend a standard timetable of core courses and participate in designated co-curricular opporuation risk being placed on Academic Probation with a reduced credit allotment or being assigned a Failed Year and being required to withdraw from the University (see Sessional Evaluation and Continuation Requirements below). Students who achieve Good Standing on a sessional evaluation but whose most recent term places them At Risk will also be subject to the terms in this paragraph.

### **Sessional Evaluation and Continuation Requirements**

There are three sessional standings: Good Standing, Academic Probation, and Failed Standing. Sessional evaluations are conducted twice yearly, after Winter Session and after Summer Session if the student was registered. The possible outcomes are listed in the table "Summary of Continuation Requirements" below. Co-operative education work terms are not included in the evaluation. If one or more courses do not have a final grade at the time that the sessional evaluation is conducted, e.g., if a final examination has been deferred, and the recorded grades in completed courses indicate that an unsatisfactory standing is likely, then eligibility for future registration may be withheld until all the grades for the session under review are final.

#### **Good Standing**

Students who enter a Winter or Summer Session in Good Standing and who pass all courses will be eligible to continue their studies in Good Standing. If they do not pass all courses but attain a sessional average of 55.0% or more they will also be eligible to continue in Good Standing.

Students who enter a session on Academic Probation must take at least 12 credits in a session, must successfully complete all courses attempted and must attain a sessional average of at least 55.0% to leave the session in Good Standing.

#### **Academic Probation Standing**

Students who enter a session in Good Standing then fail one or more courses and attain a sessional average of less than 55.0% but at least 50.0% will be placed on Academic Probation.

A student who is on Academic Probation is restricted to taking no more than 12 credits in either term of Winter Session or no more than 11 credits during Summer Session. That student must also submit an academic plan to an advisor in the [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) during each study term. A meeting with the advisor may be required.

#### **Failed Standing**

Students who attain a sessional average of less than 50.0% in any Winter or Summer Session will be assigned Failed Standing. If this sessional average is based on fewer than 12 credits and the student entered the session in Good Standing, the student will be permitted to continue under the conditions described above under Academic Probation Standing. Otherwise, the student will be required to withdraw from the University entirely.

Students who attain a sessional average of at least 50.0% but less than 55.0%, having failed one or more courses, will be assigned Failed Standing if they entered the session on Academic Probation or with Failed Standing in any previous session. Such students will be required to withdraw from the University entirely.

### **Summary of Continuation Requirements**

The continuation requirements outlined in the table below are determined through sessional evaluation, with new standing based on prior standing, sessional average, and success in courses.

A student who is assigned Failed Standing and is not permitted to continue will be required to withdraw from the University. See [Advancement Regulations](https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,43,0,0#234). 

Normally, the student will be required to withdraw immediately. However, a student registered in and attending one or more courses will be permitted to complete those courses only if the determination of Failed standing is made after the last date for withdrawal from courses without a 'W' being recorded on the transcript.

A student whose Winter or Summer Session is assigned Failed standing and who is required to withdraw may appeal in writing to the Faculty of Science Admissions, Adjudication, and Appeals Committee according to the instructions that will be emailed. A student who is required to withdraw may not register for or attend courses while awaiting the results of the appeal, except as noted above.

Students are restricted in the number of credits that may be attempted before completing the Communication Requirement, before gaining promotion to the next year level, and before qualifying for graduation. Students who fail to meet these requirements within the allotted credit limits will be required to withdraw. See the [Bachelor of Science Communication Requirement](/node/15384), and [Promotion Requirement](/node/15388). Normally such a student will not be eligible for readmission, but an appeal can be submitted (see below).

A student who is required to withdraw may apply for readmission after one full year, but such a student does not have the right to automatic readmission.

The Faculty committee will expect students with a Failed standing who had successfully completed fewer than 60 science-eligible credits to demonstrate their abilities by earning at least 21 transferable credits at a recognized post-secondary institution and attaining an overall GPA of 3.01, calculated on all university-transfer work attempted after they leave UBC.

Students required to withdraw after completing more than 60 Science-eligible credits may choose to take courses at a college or similar institution, in order to demonstrate a renewed ability to achieve academic success, even though some or all of the credits so earned may not be transferable to the degree.

A student who had been required to withdraw from studies in Science and later successfully appealed for readmission will be subject to the [academic standing rules](/node/15380) applicable to students with Academic Probation standing.

A student in Good Standing may take an [Academic Leave](/node/15382) for one academic year and retain eligibility to register in the following academic session. Students who have interrupted their studies may find that requirements have changed since the period of their previous enrolment. Also, students should note that some required courses are offered on an alternate-year basis.

A student in good standing who leaves the program for more than one academic year and is interested in returning must apply for re-admission. In order to be re-admitted the student must normally meet the following requirements:

1.  The student must be eligible to continue their studies within the appropriate year level standing. See [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388) to ensure that the necessary requirements have been met without exceeding the credit limits noted which would require discontinuation of study in the Faculty of Science;
2.  The student’s academic record must be competitive within the enrolment capacity of the intended program of study and specialization;
3.  The student must complete the degree within the normal seven-year time limit. See information about the seven-year time limit under [General Academic Regulations](/node/15404).

Applications for re-admission should be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Office together with a letter of appeal which will be considered by the Science Admissions, Adjudication, and Appeals Committee. In considering an application for readmission, the Committee will take into account any and all evidence of a student's ability to perform satisfactorily at the university level. A written self-assessment, documentation of action taken to rectify personal issues that interfered with academic progress (if applicable), and a reasoned academic plan are among the items that will be reviewed.

A negative decision by the Faculty on an application for re-admission may be appealed to the Senate Admissions Committee. That Committee does not change decisions of the Faculty based on academic judgment, but may grant an appeal if due process was not followed by the Faculty. Thus, unless the appellant supplies additional information in support of special consideration, the appeal to Senate is unlikely to succeed.

1If, in a particular year, the minimum GPA for transfer applicants is less than 3.0, the lower GPA will apply.
Students in good academic standing after a Winter Session normally are eligible to register in the following Summer and Winter Sessions but may choose instead to take an Academic Leave of up to one academic year.

If the student chooses not to register in the Winter Session immediately following the last one attended, the student will retain eligibility to register in the next Winter Session. If a leave of longer duration is chosen, the student will have to apply for readmission through Enrolment Services; normal deadlines will apply.

The provision for Academic Leave does not apply to a student who is not in Good Standing, or has not met [Continuation](/node/15380#18554) or [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388). For example, a student who iected of graduates of the B.Sc. program. Skills will develop from critical reading of the literature in a variety of disciplines; from summarizing and synthesizing the information; and from comparing, contrasting, and defending ideas orally and in writing.

The ability to express ideas clearly, succinctly, and with authority, especially in writing, forms the basis of most assessments of learning. To ensure that all B.Sc. students develop strong academic writing skills during their degree studies, students must earn six credits from the following eligible Communication courses: WRDS 150; SCIE 113; any of ENGL 100, 110, 111, 112, 120, or 121; WRCM 1st transfer credit; SCIE 300 or CHEM 300; APSC 176; LFS 150; FRST 150; Arts One (counts for six Science communication credits); ASTU 100, 101; or their equivalents. These credits may not be earned through Credit/D/Fail standings. Credit will be granted for only one of WRDS 150 or ENGL 112. SCIE 113 is available only to first-year B.Sc. students. SCIE 300 is normally available only to students accepted into the Combined Major in Science. CHEM 300 is available only to students accepted into a Chemistry specialization. APSC 176 is available only to students in the Faculty of Applied Science. LFS 150 is available only to students in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems. FRST 150 is available only to students in the Faculty of Forestry. ENGL 100 and ASTU courses are primarily for students in the Faculty of Arts.

All students admitted to the B.Sc. program must take immediate steps to satisfy the Communication Requirement (if they have not done so with advance credit). The pattern of registration priority by year-level makes it more difficult for a student to register in first-year courses after being promoted out of first year.

Students admitted to a first-degree program who have not met the Communication Requirement by the time they have met the other requirements for promotion to fourth-year standing will not be promoted or permitted to enrol in courses other than approved Communication courses until the requirement is met. (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)).

The following notes apply:

1.  Students admitted directly from secondary school are encouraged to take at least one Communication course in their first year. To be eligible to register in WRDS, ENGL or other eligible courses, students may need to fulfill course-specific entry requirements. For details, refer to the relevant unit or course requirements.
2.  Students admitted directly from secondary school who recognize a need to improve their writing skills are encouraged to make use of the resources of the Centre for Writing and Scholarly Communication in the Chapman Learning Commons. In order to allow time for this work, students are encouraged not to register in more than 13 credits of coursework per term in their first winter session unless they are registered in an eligible Communication course.
3.  Students admitted directly from secondary school who have not earned credit for at least one Communication course by the time they qualify for promotion to third-year standing will have their access to credit courses restricted so that they do not exceed the maximum of 78 attempted credits for a third-year student (see [Promotion Requirements](/node/15388)) without completing the Communication Requirement.
4.  Students admitted directly from secondary school who have earned credit for one Communication course prior to being promoted to third-year standing are expected to complete a second Communication course in the next winter session. The limits on attempted credits in 3 above apply.
5.  Students who are accepted into year one or transfer from another program in UBC or from other post-secondary institutions will be subject to the conditions in notes 1 - 4 above.
6.  Students who are accepted into year two or three on transfer from another program in UBC or from other post-secondary institutions, or who are readmitted to the Faculty after being required to withdraw, will be assigned a year-level determined by the general Promotion Requirements and will thereafter be subject to those requirements. Students admitted after completing a prior degree are subject to [special Promotion Requirements](/node/15390#18497). After the first winter session, each student’s progress will be reviewed and appropriate credit restrictions or requirements for remedial work will be implemented if the Communication Requirement has not been met.

Students should reflect on the skills they develop as they progress through their degrees. It is important to recognize both the similarities and the differences between academic disciplines in the conventions of effective communication and to look for courses other than WRDS, or ENGL (in the course offerings in Science and other faculties) that provide students with opportunities to improve their reading, writing, and sometimes oral skills. Opportunities to further develop strong communication skills also occur outside the classroom, whether in study groups, clubs and other social activities, community service, or paid work.
At least 72 credits must be in science courses. Only Geography courses identified with the GEOS (or GEOB) subject code carry science credit. In addition to PSYC 348 and 448, all undergraduate psychology courses numbered 60 to 89 in the last two digits have science credit. Only the following courses in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems have science credit: FNH 350, 351, 450, and 451. Some courses in the Faculty of Medicine have science credit: all BIOC, CAPS, and PCTH courses; MEDG 410-421.

### Arts Requirement

At least 12 credits must be in courses offered by the Faculty of Arts, excluding GEOS (or GEOB) courses and PSYC courses with science credit (see [Science Requirement](#18439)). Arts credits taken to fulfill the [Communication Requirement](/node/15384) may not be counted towards the Arts Requirement.

ASIC 200 and ASIC 220, which are jointly offered by Science and Arts, will be applied as Arts Credit for Science students.

All MUSC courses in music history, music theory, ethnomusicology, or music composition, and a maximum of 8 credits from the ensemble courses in musical performance, may count as Arts credits in a B.Sc. program.
All B.Sc. students are required to have reasonable breadth in their understanding of science.

For the purposes of this requirement, courses for Science credit are separated into 7 categories by course codes:

1\. Mathematics: All MATH courses, except MATH 3022. Chemistry: All CHEM courses, except CHEM 100, CHEM 3003. Physics: All PHYS courses, except PHYS 1004. Life Science: All BIOL courses except BIOL 140, BIOL 300; all BIOC, PSYC (courses numbered from 60 to 89 in the last 2 digits), and MICB courses and GEOS (or GEOB) 2075. Statistics: BIOL 300, DSCI 100, MATH 302, all STAT courses6. Computer Science: All CPSC courses

7\. Earth & Planetary Science: All ASTR, ATSC, ENVR, EOSC, GEOS or GEOB courses except EOSC 111 and GEOS (or GEOB) 207.

Students in a major or honours specialization must successfully complete at least 3 credits from any 6 of the 7 categories. Students in a combined major or combined honours specialization must successfully complete at least 3 credits from any 5 of the 7 categories.

These courses can be at any level.

Students must satisfy at least all but one of the required categories before they can be promoted to fourth year. That is, students in a combined specialization must satisfy 4 of the required 5 categories and students in a non-combined specialization must satisfy 5 of the required 6 categories.

Students who successfully complete Science One (SCIE 001) are credited with having successfully completed at least 3 credits from the Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Life Science categories.
### Foundational Requirement

All B.Sc. students must successfully complete appropriate foundational courses in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.

Students admitted to the B.Sc. with credit for neither Biology 11 nor Biology 12 must successfully complete 3 credits of 100-level BIOL (usually BIOL 111). Students without credit for Chemistry 12 must successfully complete CHEM 100, CHEM 110 or CHEM 111. Students without credit for Physics 12 must successfully complete 3 credits of 100-level PHYS (usually PHYS 100).

### Laboratory Science Requirement

All students are required to have experience with scientific thinking and practice in a lab course where they observe or interact with the real world. Students must complete one course selected from the following list: ASTR 101, ASTR 102, BIOL 140, CHEM 111, CHEM 115, CHEM 121, CHEM 123, CHEM 135, EOSC 111, PHYS 101, PHYS 107, PHYS 109, PHYS 119, PHYS 159, SCIE 001.

Advance credit or placement, or transfer credit, may be granted where appropriate when the equivalent of any or all of these courses is completed at another institution prior to admission to the University.

Students intending to apply for entry to another degree program at UBC or elsewhere should refer to the entrance requirements for each of those academic units. These requirements must be included within an option and specialization that meet the requirements of the Faculty of Science.

Students are reminded that the regulations listed under [Academic Performance and Continuation](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/academic-performance-review-and-continuation) apply.

### Additional Lower-level Courses

Students take additional courses chosen from Science or Arts as required to fulfill prerequisites for the intended area or areas of study. Regarding credit from other faculties, see Credit at [UBC and Elsewhere](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/credit-ubc-and-elsewhere) and [General Degree Requirements](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/general-degree-requirements).
For upper-level credit requirements, see the  concurrent option offers capable students in eligible specializations the opportunity to earn a Bachelor of Science degree (B.Sc., Major) and a Bachelor of Education degree (B.Ed.) in Secondary Education concurrently in five years. After completing all the requirements, students are normally eligible for a British Columbia Professional Teaching Certificate. Students must satisfy all of the degree and specialization requirements for both the major in the Bachelor of Science and the Bachelor of Education Secondary program. Some individual courses may be considered to satisfy requirements for both degrees. Students will not be adjudicated for graduation for one degree before requirements for both are complete.

The Dual Degree in Science and Education is currently open only to students pursuing a major in mathematics or physics. For detailed descriptions of specialization requirements consult the [Mathematics](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/mathematics) or [Physics](/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-science/bachelor-science/physics) listings.

The Dual Degree option is not open to students with a previous degree.

Students must communicate with an advisor in the [Science Advising](../../index.cfm%EF%B9%96tree=12,215,410,405.html) and the [Teacher Education Office](http://teach.educ.ubc.ca/) annually after admission to the program to discuss their progress.

#### Admission

Application for admission can be found on the [Science website](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/dual). Students apply in the fall of second year after gaining admission to the appropriate major program in Science and must receive approval from the Faculties of Science and Education. All students will initially be accepted on a provisional basis. Admission will be confirmed only after successful completion of year two and successful completion of the in-school practicum in May following second year. A criminal records check is required of all teacher candidates admitted to the B.Ed. program.

Admission at any time is conditional; maintenance of good academic standing and an average of at least 65% in each session are required throughout. Students who do not maintain a 65% average will be required to withdraw from Education, but may continue with the B.Sc. Major if they meet the continuation requirements.

### Dual Degree in Science and Music

This option offers capable students the opportunity to earn a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Music degree concurrently in most combinations of one Science (B.Sc.) major and one Music (B.Mus.) major. Most combinations can be completed in six winter sessions. Students will not be adjudicated for graduation for one degree before requirements for both are complete.

Admission to the B.Mus. program requires an audition. Interested B.Sc. students must consult a senior advisor in the School of Music at the time of application to UBC. Admitted B.Sc. students who are recommended by the School of Music may find the application for admission to the Dual Degree option on the [Science website](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/dual).

Acceptance into the option will be based on the recommendation from the School of Music and a review of both the applicant's transcript and a statement of academic purpose.

Registered first- or second-year B.Sc. students may apply to the Dual Degree option but they must meet the admission requirements of the School of Music. Applications from students with a higher year standing will not be considered.

Admission to specializations within Science and Music may be competitive and admission to the Dual Degree option does not imply future admission to particular specializations.

The Dual Degree option is not open to students with a previous degree.

Admission at any time is conditional; maintenance of good academic standing and at least a 68% (B-) average in each term are required throughout. Students must satisfy all of the degree and specialization requirements for both the major in the Bachelor of Science and the major in the Bachelor of Music. Individual courses may be considered to satisfy requirements for both degrees; MUSC courses may satisfy the Arts and Breadth requirements for the B.Sc. major program. MUSC courses numbered below 300 may not count toward the upper-level credit requirement for the B.Sc. program.

Students should endeavour to satisfy lower-level course prerequisites for both specializations in their first two years. Students must communicate with an advisor in [Science Advising](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/advising) prior to enrolling in their first year of courses and at least annually thereafter.
Students who wish to focus their electives may, with the approval of the Assistant Dean Students in [Science Advising](https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising), undertake an optional minor specialization concurrently with their first specialization (major, honours, combined major, combined honours, and General Science except as noted below for specific minors). Applications will not be accepted once the student has gained fourth-year standing; some minors have further restrictions (see below). The designation of the minor will be applied to the transcript upon graduation if permission has been granted and the requirements are met. Permission to pursue a minor will be denied if the student is not making good progress in the primary specialization or if the student is already approved to pursue another minor, a double major, or dual degree.

The following minors are available: Minor in Land and Food Systems, Minor in Arts, Minor in Commerce, Minor in Kinesiology, and Minor in Science. Entry into and continuation in a minor option requires that the student remains in [Good Standing](/node/15380#18556). Where space in courses required for a minor is limited, students may be required to maintain a sessional average higher than the minimum for Good Standing. Information on minor specializations is also available from the [Faculty](http://www.science.ubc.ca/students/degree/minors).

### Minor in Land and Food Systems

The Faculty of Land and Food Systems offers several optional minors for B.Sc. students. Upon completion of one of the following minor options, the notation "Minor in \[Subject\]" will be denoted on the student's transcript.
